    "description": "You are given a string str consisting of lowercase letters and an array vowels containing the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a specific order. Additionally, you have an integer k, which represents the step size for moving through the vowels array during the replacement process.\nYour task is to write a function that replaces all the vowels in the string str with the values from the vowels array based on the specified step k. Start the replacement from the kth value from the end in the vowels array, and after each replacement, move k steps further in the vowels array. If there are no further vowels on the left from the current index in vowels, wrap around to the end of the vowels array.\nExample 1:\nstr = \"hello\", k = 2\noutput = \"holle\"\nExample 2:\nstr = \"Train\", k = 2\noutput = \"Troen\"",

Each trip is represented by three integers numPassengers[i], from[i], and to[i], where numPassengers[i] indicates the number of passengers for the ith trip, and from[i] and to[i] represent the locations to pick them up and drop them off, respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.\nThe car can only drive east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west). Your task is to determine whether it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips without exceeding the car's capacity at any point during the journey.\nExample 1:\nInput: `trips = [[2, 1, 5], [3, 3, 7]]`, `capacity = 4`\nOutput: `False`\nExplanation: The car can pick up two passengers at location 1 and drop them off at location 5. Then, the car cannot pick up three passengers at location 3 since the total capacity is 4 and 2 passengers would already be sitting there.\nExample 2:\nInput: `trips = [[3, 2, 7], [1, 7, 10]]`, `capacity = 4`\nOutput: `True`\nExplanation: The car can pick up three passengers at location 2 and drop them off at location 7.

Vasant Vihar Branch, CP branch, etc).\nEach branch can have three different types of vehicles (VehicleType): Sedan, Hatchback, SUV. There could be any number of vehicles of each type in a branch.\nThe rental price per hour should be defined at “per branch per vehicle type” level and NOT at an individual vehicle level. (eg. Sedan in CP branch = 150 rs/hr, Sedan in Vasant Vihar = 100 rs/hr, Hatchback in CP = 80rs/hr and so on)\nA user can request to rent a particular vehicle type for a given time slot. You will have to allot the vehicle from one of the branches if available for the given time slot with the “lowest rental price” strategy.\nThe following APIs have to be implemented: Note: The given parameters are the mandatory parameters, you are free to add more parameters as part of your APIs if you feel the need to do so. The return type of each API is up to you but make sure it provides the relevant information needed.\naddBranch(branchName)\nThis will add a new branch for your Service.\nallocatePrice(branchName, vehicleType, price);\nThis will be used to define price per vehicle type per branch\naddVehicle(vehicleId, vehicleType, branchName);\nThis will add a new vehicle of the given vehicle type in a given existing branch.\nbookVehicle(vehicleType, startTime, endTime)\nThis will be used to rent a vehicle for the given vehicle type for a given time slot defined by Start time and end time.

    "description": "You are given a forest with n trees. The heights of the trees are stored in an array trees[], where trees[i] denotes the height of the ith tree in the forest. If the ith tree is cut at a height H, then the amount of wood collected is trees[i] - H, provided trees[i] > H. Your task is to find the height H at which every tree should be cut (all trees have to be cut at the same height) such that the total wood collected is exactly equal to k. If it is not possible to collect exactly k units of wood, return -1; otherwise, return the height H.\nInput:\ntrees: A list of integers representing the heights of the trees in the forest. (1 ≤ len(trees) ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ trees[i] ≤ 10^6)\nk: An integer representing the total wood that needs to be collected. (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^9)\nOutput:\nAn integer representing the height H at which every tree should be cut. If it is not possible to collect exactly k units of wood, return -1.\nExample 1:\ntrees[] = [3, 6, 2, 8, 7]\nk = 15\nOutput: -1\n\nExplanation:\nIn the given example, if we cut all trees at \nFor H=6, we collect wood (3-6) + (6-6) + (2-6) + (8-6) + (7-6) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 3 units of wood, which is less than k = 15. \nFor H=5, we collect wood (3-5) + (6-5) + (2-5) + (8-5) + (7-5) = 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 2 = 6 units of wood, which is less than k = 15. \nFor H=4, we collect wood (3-4) + (6-4) + (2-4) + (8-4) + (7-4) = 0 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 3 = 9 units of wood, which is less than k = 15. \nFor H=3, we collect wood (3-3) + (6-3) + (2-3) + (8-3) + (7-3) = 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 4 = 12 units of wood, which is less than k = 15. \nFor H=2, we collect wood (3-2) + (6-2) + (2-2) + (8-2) + (7-2) = 1 + 4 + 0 + 6 + 5 = 16 units of wood, which is more than k = 15. \nIf we reduce H further, total would collected will further increase.\nTherefore, there is no H possible, hence ans is -1.\nExample 2:\nInput:\ntrees[] = [2, 3, 6, 2, 4]\nk = 4\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Wood collected by cutting trees at height 3 = 0 + 0 + (6-3) + 0 + (4-3) = 4",

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows for efficient retrieval and insertion of data.\nYour task is to implement the following functionalities for the hash table:\nput(key, value): Insert a key-value pair into the hash table.\nget(key): Retrieve the value associated with a given key from the hash table.\nremove(key): Remove the key-value pair associated with a given key from the hash table.\nTo handle collisions, you can use separate chaining or open addressing.

When a node is burned, it sets fire to its adjacent nodes (left, right, and parent) in one unit of time.

    "description": "You are planning a circular road trip and have a car with an unlimited gas tank. Along the circular route, there are n gas stations, and the amount of gas at the ith station is given by the array gas. Additionally, it costs cost[i] units of gas to travel from the ith station to its next station (i + 1) in the clockwise direction.\nYou must start your journey at one of the gas stations and travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction. Your goal is to determine the starting gas station's index, such that you can complete the trip without running out of gas.\nWrite a function findStartingGasStation to find the starting gas station's index. If a valid starting station exists, return its index; otherwise, return -1. If there is a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.\nThe function should take two integer arrays as input:\ngas: An array representing the amount of gas at each station (positive integers).\ncost: An array representing the cost of travel between stations (positive integers).\nExample 1:\nInput: \ngas [ ] = [1,2,3,4,5], \ncost[ ] = [3,4,5,1,2]\n\nOutput:  3\n\nExplanation:\n- Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 units of gas. \n- Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\n- Travel to station 4. Tank gas = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8\n- Travel to station 0. Tank gas = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7\n- Travel to station 1. Tank gas = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6\n- Travel to station 2. Tank gas = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5\n- Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. \n- Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.\n\nThus, starting at index 3, you’ll be able to make a complete circular traversal.\nExample 2:\nInput:\ngas[] = [2, 3, 4],\ncost[] = [3, 4, 3]\n\nOutput:\n-1\n\nExplanation:\nNo matter which gas station you start from, you will not have enough gas to complete the circuit without running out.",

    "description": "The count-and-say sequence is a unique sequence of digit strings that follows a recursive formula. To generate a count-and-say sequence, we start with the base case: countAndSay(1) = \"1\". To calculate countAndSay(n) for n greater than 1, we take the result from countAndSay(n-1) and \"say\" it according to certain rules.\nTo \"say\" a digit string, we split it into the minimal number of substrings, with each substring containing exactly one unique digit. For each of these substrings, we count the number of consecutive occurrences of that digit and then say the digit itself. Finally, we concatenate the results for all substrings to create the count-and-say representation.\nInput:\nAn integer n (1 <= n <= 30), representing the position of the count-and-say sequence to generate.\nOutput:\nA string representing countAndSay(n), the count-and-say sequence at position n.\nExample1:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: \"1\"\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: \"1211\"\nExplanation: \n  - countAndSay(1) = \"1\"\n  - countAndSay(2) = \"11\" (one 1), \n  - countAndSay(3) = \"21\" (two 1s), \n  - countAndSay(4) = \"1211\" (one 2, then one 1).\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 6\nOutput: \"312211\"\nExplanation:\nExplanation: \n  - countAndSay(1) = \"1\"\n  - countAndSay(2) = \"11\" (one 1), \n  - countAndSay(3) = \"21\" (two 1s), \n  - countAndSay(4) = \"1211\" (one 2, then one 1).\n  - countAndSay(5) = \"111221\" (one 1, one 2, two 1s),\n  - countAndSay(6) = \"312211\" (three 1s, two 2s, one 1).",

A connection pool is a crucial component for improving the performance and resource utilization of database connections, particularly in applications where multiple threads may require concurrent database access. Your design should ensure that multiple threads can safely acquire, use, and release database connections without conflicts or contention.\nDesign Requirements:\nConnection Pool Management:\nCreate and maintain a pool of database connections.\nLimit the maximum number of connections in the pool to prevent resource exhaustion.\nThread Safety:\nImplement mechanisms to make the connection pool thread-safe.\nEnsure that multiple threads can safely request and release connections without data corruption or resource leaks.\nConnection Reuse:\nReuse connections to minimize the overhead of creating and destroying connections for each database request.\nConnection Validation:\nValidate connections before handing them to requesting threads to ensure they are in a usable state.\nTimeouts and Wait Strategies:\nHandle cases where all connections in the pool are in use, including timeouts and wait strategies for thread contention.\nResource Cleanup:\nEnsure that connections are properly released and resources are cleaned up when connections are closed or returned to the pool.\nCompatibility:\nThe connection pool should be compatible with different database systems and connection libraries.\nExample:\n// Example of using a thread-safe connection pool in Java\nConnectionPool pool = new ConnectionPool(\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb\", \"username\", \"password\");\ntry (Connection connection = pool.getConnection()) {\n    // Use the connection for database operations\n    // ...\n} catch (SQLException e) {\n    // Handle exceptions\n} finally {\n    pool.releaseConnection(connection);\n}",

If isLeft is true, the string should be rotated to the left; otherwise, it should be rotated to the right. Rotating a string means shifting characters by the specified number of positions and wrapping around the ends of the string.\nFor example, rotating the string abcde to the left by 1 position results in bcdea, while rotating it to the right by 1 position results in eabcd. Implement a function that performs this rotation and returns the resulting string.\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"hello\", k = 2, isLeft = true  \nOutput: \"llohe\"  \nExplanation: Rotating the string \"hello\" to the left by 2 positions results in \"llohe\".\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"rotation\", k = 4, isLeft = false  \nOutput: \"tionrota\"  \nExplanation: Rotating the string \"rotation\" to the right by 4 positions results in \"tionrota\".\nExample 3:\nInput: s = \"abcdef\", k = 1, isLeft = true  \nOutput: \"bcdefa\"  \nExplanation: Rotating the string \"abcdef\" to the left by 1 position results in \"bcdefa\".",

    "description": "In a given functional graph where each node has at most one outgoing edge, your task is to find the maximum sum of edge weights in any cycle within the graph. A functional graph is a special kind of directed graph where every vertex has exactly one outgoing edge, which may lead to scenarios including self-loops and cycles.\nThe cycle with the highest sum of its constituent edge weights should be identified, and its sum returned. If the graph does not contain any cycles, the function should return 0.\nInput of edges is given where each edge is represented as: (srcNode, destNode, weight)\nExample 1:\nInput: edges = [(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 1, 5)]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: The graph contains a single cycle 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 with edge weights 3, 4, and 5 respectively. The maximum sum of edge weights in this cycle is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.\nExample 2:\nInput: edges = [(1, 2, 1), (3, 4, 2), (4, 3, 3)]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: There are two cycles in the graph: one with no edges and another 3 -> 4 -> 3 with edge weights 2 and 3.

The global counter should reflect the sum of the counts from all individual buttons.\nThe application must be dynamic, allowing for the addition or removal of buttons as needed, with the global counter updating in real-time to reflect the current total sum of all individual button counters.\nRequirements:\nInitial Setup: Start with three buttons, each labeled with a number starting from 1 (e.g., \"Button 1\", \"Button 2\", \"Button 3\") and a global counter displayed at the top or bottom of the page.\nIndividual Counters: Clicking on a button should increment its associated counter by 1.\nGlobal Counter: Display a global counter that shows the sum of the counts from all individual buttons. This counter must update in real-time as individual buttons are clicked.\nDynamic Buttons: Implement functionality to add and remove buttons dynamically. Each new button should follow the same labeling convention and have its own individual counter initialized at 0.\nState Management: Manage the state of the individual counters and the global counter efficiently to ensure the application can handle a dynamic number of buttons without significant performance degradation.\nExample Scenario:\nOn initial load, the application shows 3 buttons and a global counter.\nClicking \"Button 1\" increases its counter by 1 and updates the global counter.\nThe user adds a new button, \"Button 4\", which also interacts with the global counter as described.\nIf the counts are 5, 3, 2, and 4 for Buttons 1 through 4, respectively, the global counter should display 14.\nIf \"Button 2\" is removed, the global counter should adjust to reflect the sum of the remaining buttons' counts.\nThis problem challenges you to think about component reusability, state management across multiple components, and dynamic rendering based on the application's state in React.",

Each tuple represents an error log entry, where errorCode is an integer and timestamp is an epoch timestamp in seconds.\nFrequency Threshold: An error code should be reported if it appears more than N times within any one-hour interval throughout the list.\nOutput: Return a list of unique error codes that meet the frequency threshold within any one-hour interval.

This list is non-empty for internal nodes and empty for leaf nodes.\nThe tree (or DAG in the follow-up) is guaranteed to have at least one leaf node.\nOutput:\nAn integer representing the minimum time required for water to reach all the leaves starting from the root.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n\n    8(root)\n   / \\\n  5   3\n /     \\\nleaf   leaf\n\nOutput: 13\n\nExplanation:\n- Starting at the root (8), the minimum time for water to reach the leaf through the left child is 8 (root) + 5 (internal node) = 13.\n- Through the right child, the time is 8 (root) + 3 = 11.\n- However, we are interested in the time it takes for all leaves to get water, which is determined by the slower path, thus the answer is 13.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n      8(root)\n     / \n    5\n   / \n  3\n /\nleaf   \n\nOutput: 16",

    "description": "Given a linked list that contains a loop (i.e., the last node points back to one of the previous nodes in the list instead of pointing to null), your task is to find the node where the loop starts. This node is referred to as the \"meeting point\". You are required to solve this problem using constant extra space.\nA linked list is said to contain a loop if there exists a node in the list such that we can reach the same node again by continuously following the next pointer. The loop's \"meeting point\" is the node from which we can traverse the loop and eventually come back to it.\nInput: head: The head node of the linked list, which is an instance of ListNode. The linked list has at least one node and contains a loop.\nOutput: Return the ListNode that represents the start of the loop, i.e., the \"meeting point\" in the linked list. If the linked list does not contain a loop, return None.\nExample 1\nInput:\n`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 4` (the last node points back to the node with value `4` instead of pointing to `null`).\n\nOutput:\n4\n\nExplanation:\nIn the given linked list, the node with value `4` is the starting point of the loop. This is because starting from this node, we can follow the `next` pointers and eventually come back to the same node, thus forming a loop. Therefore, the node with value `4` is the \"meeting point\" of the loop in the linked list.",

    "description": "In an adventurous episode of the classic Tom and Jerry saga, Jerry has found himself trapped in the farthest corner of a massive house by Tom. The house is represented as an m x n grid, each cell symbolizing a different room. Tom, starting from the entrance in the top-left room, is determined to navigate through the house to catch Jerry, who is hiding in the bottom-right room.\nTom starts his pursuit with a certain number of energy points, a measure of his stamina. If at any point Tom's energy points deplete to 0 or below, he becomes too exhausted to continue the chase.\nThe rooms in the house are filled with various obstacles or boosts: some rooms have traps set by Jerry (indicated by negative integers, which drain Tom's energy upon entering), others are neutral (indicated as 0), and some contain snacks that increase Tom's energy (indicated by positive integers).\nDriven by his determination to catch Jerry as quickly as possible, Tom decides to move only rightward or downward through the house.\nYour task is to determine the minimum initial energy points Tom needs to ensure he can catch Jerry, considering the traps, neutral spaces, and energy boosts he may encounter from the very first room to the last.\nInput:\nhouse: A 2D list of integers where house[i][j] represents the condition of the room at row i and column j in the house. Negative integers represent rooms with traps, 0 represents neutral rooms, and positive integers represent rooms with energy-boosting snacks.\nOutput:\nReturn an integer representing the minimum initial energy points Tom requires to catch Jerry successfully.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nhouse = [\n    [-2, -3, 3],\n    [-5, -10, 1],\n    [10, 30, -5]\n]\n\nOutput:\n7\n\nExplanation:\nWith an initial energy of 7, Tom can follow the path: Right -> Right -> Down -> Down, ending the chase with at least 1 energy point left. This strategic path allows Tom to avoid the most severe traps while taking advantage of the snacks to maintain his energy, ensuring he catches Jerry in the end.",

    "description": "In the classic Dining Philosophers Problem, five philosophers sit at a round table with five forks (or chopsticks) placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can only take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available and they cannot start eating before getting both forks.\nEating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed. The problem is how to design a discipline of behavior (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.\nFunctional Requirements\nPhilosopher Actions: Each philosopher can perform one of three actions: think, try to pick up forks (both left and right), or eat. Philosophers must be able to pick up the forks and eat only when both their left and right forks are available.\nAvoid Deadlocks: Ensure that your solution prevents deadlock, where no philosopher can eat because each has picked up one fork and is waiting for the other.\nAvoid Starvation: Ensure that every philosopher eventually gets to eat. A solution where a philosopher could end up never eating (because of being continuously preempted by others) is not acceptable.\nConcurrency: Implement the solution in a multithreaded fashion, with each philosopher represented by a separate thread or process.\nTechnical Requirements\nLanguage: You can choose any programming language that supports multithreading and synchronization mechanisms (e.g., Java, C++, Python with threading).\nSynchronization Mechanisms: Utilize appropriate synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes, semaphores, or monitors to manage the access to forks.\nLogging: Implement logging to show the state of each philosopher (thinking, waiting for forks, eating) and the state of each fork (available, held by philosopher X).",

This situation is described using an array named transactions, where each element transactions[i] = [fromi, toi, amounti] represents a transaction indicating that the individual with ID fromi has given amounti dollars to the individual with ID toi. Your objective is to compute the minimum number of transactions necessary to settle all the debts across this group of individuals. A debt is considered settled when everyone has either received the money they are owed or paid back the money they owe, achieving a state where no one owes money to anyone else within the group.\nInput Format:\nList of transactions is give.\nEach transaction is represented as: [fromi, toi, amounti]\nExample 1:\nInput: transactions = [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The given transactions indicate that person `0` owes $10 to person `1`, and person `2` owes $5 to person `0`. Both debts can be settled directly with the given transactions, resulting in a total of 2 transactions needed to settle all debts.\nExample 2:\nInput: transactions = [[0, 1, 5], [1, 2, 7], [2, 0, 5]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: After analyzing the transactions, we can see that debts can be settled by just one final transaction of $2 from 1 to 2, thus output is 1.\nConstraints\n1 <= transactions.length <= 8\ntransactions[i].length == 3\nEach amounti is a positive integer, representing the amount of money transacted.\nThe IDs fromi and toi represent the unique identifiers for each person involved in the transactions.",

Thus, only 1 sprinkler is needed.\nExample 2:\nInput: p = [1, 0, 2, 2]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The third sprinkler covers from position 1 to 5, and the first sprinkler covers from 0 to 2. Therefore, the first and third sprinklers together can cover the entire garden, needing a minimum of 2 sprinklers.\nExample 3:\nInput: p = [0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Since all sprinklers have a power of 0, they can only water their own position. If the garden length is more than 1, it's impossible to cover the entire garden, thus returning 0.\nConstraints\n1 <= p.length <= 10^4\n0 <= p[i] <= 100",

The system should analyze these alerts based on predefined rules, which include sliding windows, tumbling windows, thresholds, and time constraints. Upon matching specific conditions, the system must trigger corresponding actions such as sending emails, SMS, or other notifications.\nThe primary focus will be on illustrating your design approach, highlighting the application of SOLID principles and other design patterns to justify your choices. The designed system should emphasize extensibility, allowing for easy adaptation to new requirements or changes in the environment. Testability is another critical aspect, with the expectation that the system can be validated against a set of test cases provided during the review. Additionally, the design should facilitate ease of use, ensuring that new users can efficiently interact with the system without a steep learning curve.",

    "description": "In this problem, you are provided with a set of elements where each element is associated with a list of properties. Properties are considered duplicates if they have the same value and are located at the same index within their respective property list. Additionally, elements exhibit transitive relationships, meaning if element1 is related to element2 and element2 is related to element3, then element1 is also related to element3.\nYour task is to construct a dependency chain that outlines the connections between elements based on their matching/duplicate properties.\nExamples:\nExample 1:\nInput:\ne1 -> p1 p2 p3\ne2 -> p4 p5 p3\ne3 -> p1 p3 p6\n\nOutput: [e1, e2, e3]\n\nExplanation:\n  - `e1` and `e2` are connected because they share a property (`p3`) at the same index.\n  - `e1` and `e3` are indirectly connected through `e2`, as `e1` shares a property with `e2` (`p3`), and `e2` shares a property with `e3` (indirectly implied by the transitive relationship through `e1`).\n  - The dependency chain forms as `e1 -> e2 -> e3` due to the shared properties, resulting in a single chain: `[e1, e2, e3]`.\nExample 2:\nInput:\ne1 -> p1 p2\ne2 -> p3 p4\ne3 -> p1 p4\n\nOutput: \n[e1, e3]\n[e2]\n\nExplanation:\n  - `e1` and `e3` are connected because they share a property (`p1`) at the same index.\n  - `e2` does not share any properties with `e1` or `e3` at the same index, making it separate.\n  - Therefore, there are two chains: `[a1, a3]` and `[a2]`.",

    "description": "You are given an array named debris that contains integers representing pieces of space debris in a linear orbit. Each piece of debris's absolute value indicates its mass, while its sign indicates its direction of travel (a positive value means it is moving clockwise, and a negative value means it is moving counter-clockwise). All pieces of debris move at the same speed.\nYour task is to simulate the collisions between these pieces of debris and determine the state of the orbit after all collisions have occurred. The rules for collision are as follows:\nIf two pieces of debris meet (one moving clockwise and the other moving counter-clockwise), the smaller one will disintegrate. In case of a tie in mass, both will disintegrate.\nTwo pieces of debris moving in the same direction will never meet and, therefore, will not collide.\nImplement a function that takes the debris array as input and returns an array representing the state of the orbit after all collisions have been resolved.\nExample 1:\nInput: debris = [4, 9, -4]\nOutput: [4, 9]\nExplanation: The 9 and -4 pieces of debris will collide, with the -4 piece disintegrating because it is smaller. The 4 and 9 pieces are moving in the same direction, so they do not collide. The final state is [4, 9].\nExample 2:\nInput: debris = [5, -5]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: The 5 and -5 pieces of debris will collide, and since they are of equal mass, both will disintegrate. The final state is an empty array [].\nExample 3:\nInput: debris = [10, 2, -5]\nOutput: [10]\nExplanation: The 2 and -5 pieces of debris will collide, with the -5 piece disintegrating because it is smaller. The 10 piece is not affected and remains. The final state is [10].\nExample 4:\nInput: debris = [-2, -1, 1, 2]\nOutput: [-2, -1, 1, 2]\nExplanation: All pieces of debris are moving away from each other, so there are no collisions.

    "description": "In Swift, optionals are a powerful feature that allows variables to either hold a value or be nil, indicating the absence of a value. This concept is crucial for handling situations where a value may or may not be present, thus avoiding runtime errors related to null references. However, imagine a scenario where the built-in optional type ? is not available due to framework constraints or for educational purposes, you are required to implement a similar functionality from scratch. Your task is to create a custom Optional type, named MyOptional, that mimics the behavior of Swift's native optional types.\nFunctional Requirements:\nGeneric Type: The MyOptional type should be generic, capable of holding any type of value.\nInitialization: It should be possible to initialize MyOptional with a value or as nil.\nUnwrapping: Implement a method to safely unwrap the value, returning a default value if the optional is none.\nOptional Chaining (Bonus): As a bonus challenge, implement a simplified form of optional chaining that allows methods and properties to be accessed on the optional's value directly from the MyOptional instance.\nExample Inputs & Outputs:\nInitialization\nInput: let myString: MyOptional<String> = MyOptional.some(\"Hello\")\nOutput: An instance of MyOptional holding the string \"Hello\".\nInput: let myNil: MyOptional<String> = MyOptional.none\nOutput: An instance of MyOptional representing none.\nUnwrapping\nInput: myString.unwrap(default: \"Default\")\nOutput: \"Hello\"\nInput: myNil.unwrap(default: \"Default\")\nOutput: \"Default\"\nTechnical Requirements:\nUse Swift as the programming language.\nMake sure your custom optional type is generic and can work with any data type.\nEnsure that your implementation is safe and follows Swift's error-handling and type-checking best practices.",

    "description": "The objective is to design and implement a system that not only performs various sorting operations on collections but also logs the steps, decisions, and outcomes of these operations. The challenge emphasizes adherence to low-level design principles, focusing on the SOLID principles and promoting clean, modular, and extensible code architecture. This system should be capable of sorting collections of integers through different algorithms and logging the process and results in a structured manner.\nFunctional Requirements:\nSorting Algorithms: Implement at least three distinct sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm should adhere to a common interface, allowing for interchangeability and flexibility in sorting strategy.\nLogging Mechanism: Develop a logging mechanism that can log messages with varying levels of importance (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and to multiple outputs (e.g., console, file). The logging format should be standardized and include timestamps.\nSorting Logger: Integrate the logging mechanism with the sorting algorithms to log key events during the sorting process, such as initialization, comparisons, swaps, and completion. The logs should provide insights into the algorithm's behavior and performance.\nTechnical Requirements:\nLanguage and Frameworks: You are free to choose an object-oriented programming language like Java, Python, or C#. If using Java, consider interfaces and abstract classes; if Python, duck typing and abstract base classes can be utilized.\nSOLID Principles: Ensure your design strictly follows SOLID principles for OOP design.\nDesign Patterns: Apply appropriate design patterns, such as Strategy for sorting algorithms and Factory or Singleton for the logging mechanism.\nError Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage invalid inputs, unsupported operations, or failures during sorting or logging.\nExample Usage:\nA user selects the Quick Sort algorithm and starts the sorting process on an array of integers. They choose to log the process to both the console and a file with INFO level.\nThe system logs the start of the sorting process, each swap made, and the final sorted array, along with the total time taken to sort.",

Return the largest product possible from these subarrays.\nThe test cases for this problem are designed such that the answer will always fit within a 32-bit integer, ensuring that you don't need to worry about exceptionally large numbers beyond the limit of a 32-bit integer storage.\nInput:\nAn integer array nums.\nOutput:\nAn integer representing the maximum product of a subarray within nums.\nConstraints:\n1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4\n-10 <= nums[i] <= 10\nThe product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,3,-2,4]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The subarray [2,3] has the largest product 6.\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [0, 2]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The contiguous subarray with the largest product is [2], as the product of 2 is greater than the product of 0.\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [-2, -3, -4]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: The contiguous subarray with the largest product is [-3, -4], with a product of -3 * -4 = 12. A negative times a negative equals a positive, and in this case, including all elements leads to the maximum product.\nExample 4:\nInput: nums = [-1, -2, -3, 0]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The contiguous subarray with the largest product is [-2, -3], with a product of -2 * -3 = 6. The presence of 0 in the array makes any subarray containing it have a product of 0, hence not the maximum.",

    "description": "Imagine you are working on an operating system's task manager, and you need to develop a simple yet efficient way to schedule jobs for the CPU to execute. The CPU can handle multiple jobs, but instead of using a Round Robin approach, you are tasked with implementing a priority-based job scheduling algorithm.\nIn this system, every job is assigned a priority value, and the CPU selects the job with the highest priority to execute next. If two jobs have the same priority, the job that arrived first (based on the submission time) should be chosen first.\nYour task is to design and implement this job scheduling system. You should be able to:\nAdd a new job to the system with a specified priority. The job can be represented by a simple ID and its priority level.\nExecute the next job: The system should be able to select and execute the job with the highest priority. After a job is executed, it is considered completed and removed from the scheduling queue.\nAssume the execution itself is instantaneous for the sake of simplicity (you don't need to simulate the actual execution time, just remove the job from the queue).\nRequirements:\nImplement a function to add a job to the queue, which takes a job ID and its priority.\nImplement a function to execute the next job, which selects the job with the highest priority that was added earliest among those with the same priority, and returns its ID.\nIf there are no jobs to execute, indicate somehow (for example, by returning null or a special value).\nExample:\nAdd job with ID \"Job1\" and priority 5.\nAdd job with ID \"Job2\" and priority 3.\nAdd job with ID \"Job3\" and priority 5.\nExecute the next job (should execute \"Job1\" because it has the highest priority and was added first).\nExecute the next job (should execute \"Job3\" because it is now the next highest priority job that was added first).\nAdditional Details:\nYou can assume the job ID is unique.\nThe priority is an integer where a higher number indicates a higher priority.",

This system should efficiently manage the booking of movie tickets in a multiplex cinema that has multiple screens, ensuring that no more tickets are sold than the available seats in each screening, even in the face of concurrent booking requests.\nThe primary challenge is to handle concurrent bookings in such a way that avoids race conditions, ensuring the integrity of the booking process. This includes preventing the sale of the same seat to multiple customers and accurately reflecting the current availability of seats.\nExample Scenario:\nThe system is initialized with a list of movies, each having multiple screenings throughout the day. Each screening has 100 available seats.\nCustomer A and Customer B simultaneously attempt to book 4 tickets each for the same screening of Movie X at 7:00 PM.\nThe system processes both requests. If there are at least 8 seats available, both bookings should succeed. If there are fewer than 8 seats available, one booking should succeed, and the other should be declined based on the system's concurrency handling logic.\nAfter the bookings are processed, the seat availability for the 7:00 PM screening of Movie X should reflect the updated number of booked seats.",

    "description": "Given a non-empty string word and an abbreviation abbr, write a function to check if abbr is a valid abbreviation of word.\nA valid abbreviation of a word follows the rules:\nabbr is a substring of word with skipped letters represented by numbers. The number represents the count of the letters that are omitted in the abbreviation. For example, the abbreviation a2le for the word apple means that the letters pp (2 letters) are skipped.\nConsecutive skipped letters can only be represented by one number. For example, a10e is invalid for apple since there are not 10 characters between a and e.\nThe abbreviation cannot have leading zeros. For instance, a01 is invalid.\nThe letters in the abbreviation abbr appear in the same order as in word.\nExample 1:\nInput: word = \"internationalization\", abbr = \"i12iz4n\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation: The abbreviation \"i12iz4n\" can be expanded to \"internationalization\" which is the same as the word.\nExample 2:\nInput: word = \"apple\", abbr = \"a2le\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation: The abbreviation \"a2le\" skips the 2 letters \"pp\" in \"apple\".\nExample 3:\nInput: word = \"apple\", abbr = \"a10e\"\nOutput: False\nExplanation: \"a10e\" suggests that there are 10 letters skipped between 'a' and 'e', which is not the case for \"apple\".\nExample 4:\nInput: word = \"apple\", abbr = \"a01\"\nOutput: False\nExplanation: The abbreviation has a leading zero, which is not allowed.",

Your task is to identify the celebrity, if one exists, using the minimum number of questions. You can only ask questions in the form of &quot;Does person A know person B?&quot;\n\n###### Implementation Details:\n- You will be provided a function `knows(a, b)` which returns `True` if person &#39;a&#39; knows person &#39;b&#39;, otherwise it returns `False`.\n- Implement a function `findCelebrity(n)` where `n` is the number of people at the party. This function should return the index of the celebrity if they exist, or -1 if there is no celebrity.\n\n###### Example1:\n**Input:**\n`n = 4`, Suppose the calls to `knows(a, b)` are configured such that:\n- `knows(0, 2)` returns `True`\n- `knows(1, 2)` returns `True`\n- `knows(2, 0)` returns `False`\n- `knows(2, 1)` returns `True`\n- `knows(3, 2)` returns `True`\n- All other calls where a person checks if they know themselves return `False`.\n\n**Expected Output:**\nThe celebrity is person 2, as everyone else knows them, and they know no one.\n\n###### Constraints:\n- \\( 1 \\leq n \\leq 1000 \\)\n- You should minimize the number of calls to `knows(a, b)`.\n Whatever kind of mentorship session you need. Be it mock interview, career guidance or anything. We have got you covered. We have various experts with different background and expertise.

    "description": "You are asked to design and implement a thread pool library that manages execution of multiple jobs using a fixed number of worker threads. The goal is to ensure that incoming jobs are executed efficiently without creating a new thread for every request.\nYour design should meet the following requirements:\nThread Pool Initialization\nThe thread pool should be initialized with a fixed number of worker threads (configurable during creation).\nAll worker threads should remain alive and ready to take jobs until the pool is shut down.\nJob Submission\nA client should be able to submit jobs (units of work) to the thread pool.\nEach job will be represented as a function/task that needs to be executed.\nJobs may come in faster than they can be executed, so there must be a way to hold them in a queue until a thread is free.\nJob Execution\nIdle worker threads should pick jobs from the queue and execute them.\nMultiple jobs may be submitted concurrently from different client threads.\nNo job should be lost; all submitted jobs must eventually run.\nThread Safety\nThe design must handle synchronization properly so that jobs are not missed or executed multiple times.\nMultiple clients submitting jobs at the same time should not cause corruption in the queue.\nShutdown Mechanism\nThe library should support a graceful shutdown.\nAfter shutdown is initiated, no new jobs should be accepted, but already submitted jobs should still complete.\nWorker threads should exit cleanly once all jobs are processed.\nAdditional Considerations\nIf the job queue is empty, worker threads should wait without consuming CPU unnecessarily.\nIf the queue has jobs but all threads are busy, the new jobs should wait in the queue until a worker becomes available.\nExample Scenario:\nInitialize a thread pool with 4 threads.\nSubmit 10 jobs where each job prints its ID and simulates work by sleeping for 2 seconds.\nObserve that at most 4 jobs are processed at the same time, and the rest wait until a thread is free.",

    "description": "Find the shortest byte sequence that is not present in a given array of bytes. This array could be represented in various forms such as a C++ string, a character array, or a uint8_t array. The byte values in this array range from 'a' to 'f' (which represent hexadecimal values in ASCII).\nObjective: Find and return the shortest byte sequence that does not exist anywhere in the input byte array. The length of the returned sequence must be 4 bytes or fewer.\nInput:\nAn array of bytes that could be potentially very large (up to 4GB in size).\nThe byte values will only be between 'a' (97 in ASCII) and 'f' (102 in ASCII).\nOutput:\nA string representing the shortest sequence of bytes that is not present in the input. The sequence must consist of characters between 'a' to 'f' and its length should not exceed 4 characters.\nExample:\nInput: \"abcdefacbeddefd\"\nOutput: \"aa\"\n\nExplanation: Single characters from 'a' to 'f' are all present. The two-character sequence \"aa\" does not appear in the input.\n\n\"a\" is present\n\"b\" is present\n..\n\"f\" is present\n\"aa\" is not present\n\"ab\" is present\n\"ac\" is present\n\nYou can return \"aa\" or \"ad\" or \"ae\"... \"ff\"\nBut not \"ab\" \"ac\" \"bc\"\nConstraints:\nInput contains arbitrary bytes ('\\x00' to '\\xff'), not only letters\nSmall testcase: input length <= 16MB\nLarge testcase: input length <= 4GB\nYou have 8GB ram",

In this scenario, a rook can move to another position and capture a rook on that position, removing it from the chessboard. The goal is to minimize the number of rooks such that no rooks can attack each other directly in a final stable configuration. The initial positions of the K rooks are provided as input, and rooks can make any number of moves.\nExample 1:\nInput: N = 4, K = 3, Positions = [(0,0), (1,1), (3,3)]\nOutput: 1\n\nExplanation: One possible sequence of moves could be:\n- Rook at (1,1) moves to (0,0) and captures the rook. Remaining positions: [(1,1), (3,3)]\n- Rook at (3,3) moves to (1,1) and captures the rook. Final positions: [(3,3)]\nThus, only 1 rook remains.\nExample 2:\nInput: N = 4, K = 4, Positions = [(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (3,3)]\nOutput: 2\n\nExplanation: One possible sequence of moves could be:\n- Rook at (0,1) moves to (0,0) and captures the rook. Remaining positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (3,3)]\n- Rook at (1,0) moves to (0,1) and captures the rook. Final positions: [(1,0), (3,3)]\nThus, 2 rooks remain, each unable to attack the other.",

This operation may take O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in that version.\nEach push or pop operation creates a new version of the stack.

This function is common in React applications to conditionally apply CSS classes to components based on props, state, or any other data.\nThe function should be able to handle various types of inputs including strings, objects, and arrays. If an object is passed, the keys whose corresponding values are truthy should be included in the output class string.\nFunction Signature:\nfunction classNames(...args): string\nExample:\nInput:\nclassNames('btn', 'btn-primary', { disabled: false, active: true }, ['rounded', null])\n\nOutput:\n'btn btn-primary active rounded'\n\nExplanation:\n- `'btn'` and `'btn-primary'` are direct string inputs.\n- `{ disabled: false, active: true }` results in 'active' being added because it is truthy.\n- `['rounded', null]` results in 'rounded' being added because it is a non-falsy string; `null` is ignored.",

The function should read through the entire file, count the occurrences of each IP address, and return the IP address that appears the most frequently.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n111.33.44.55-hello-787-test\n111.33.44.55-hello-787-test\n112.53.47.45-reemag-787-teskkkt\n\nOutput: 111.33.44.55\n\nExplanation: The IP address '111.33.44.55' appears twice in the log, making it the most frequent IP address in the given data.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n192.168.1.1-info-123-data\n10.0.0.1-update-124-info\n192.168.1.1-info-123-data\n192.168.1.1-info-123-data\n\nOutput: 192.168.1.1\n\nExplanation: The IP address '192.168.1.1' appears three times, while other IP addresses appear less frequently, making '192.168.1.1' the most frequent IP address.",

    "description": "Write a function that determines the maximum profit from buying and selling a single share of stock given a list of daily prices. The function should take an array of prices where each element represents the stock price on a particular day. You are only permitted to complete one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), and you must sell the stock after you buy it. Calculate and return the maximum profit you can achieve. If no profit is possible, return 0.\nExample 1:\nInput: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]\nOutput: 5\n\nExplanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5. Not 7 - 1 = 6, as selling price needs to be after buying price.\nExample 2:\nInput: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]\nOutput: 0\n\nExplanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e., max profit = 0.",
