    "description": "You are given an m x n 2D grid maze representing a maze. Each cell in the maze is either:\nAn empty cell represented by '.'\nA wall represented by '+'\nYou are also given an array entrance = [entrance_row, entrance_col] representing the row and column of the entrance cell in the maze.\nIn one step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze.\nYour goal is to find the nearest exit from the entrance. An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the border of the maze. The entrance does not count as an exit.\nReturn the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit, or -1 if no such path exists.\nInput:\nmaze: A list of lists representing the maze grid, where each element is either '.' or '+'.\nentrance: A list [entrance_row, entrance_col] representing the coordinates of the entrance cell.\nOutput:\nAn integer representing the minimum number of steps to reach the nearest exit from the entrance. If no exit is reachable, return -1.\nExamples:\nExample 1:\nInput:\nmaze = [\n  [\"+\", \"+\", \".\", \"+\"],\n  [\"+\", \".\", \".\", \"+\"],\n  [\"+\", \"+\", \"+\", \".\"]\n]\nentrance = [1, 2]\n\nOutput:\n1\n\nExplanation:\nThere are three exits in this maze at `[0,2]`, and `[2,3]`.\nThe entrance is at `[1,2]`.\nYou can reach `[0,2]` by moving 1 step up.\n\nThus, the nearest exit is `[0,2]`, which is 1 step away.\nExample 2:\nInput:\nmaze = [\n  [\"+\", \"+\", \"+\"],\n  [\".\", \".\", \".\"],\n  [\"+\", \"+\", \"+\"]\n]\nentrance = [1, 0]\n\nOutput:\n2\n\nExplanation:\n\nThere is one exit in this maze at `[1,2]`.\nThe entrance is at `[1,0]`, which is not an exit.\nYou can reach `[1,2]` by moving 2 steps right.\nThus, the nearest exit is `[1,2]`, which is 2 steps away.\nConstraints:\nmaze.length == m\nmaze[i].length == n\n1 <= m, n <= 100\nmaze[i][j] is either '.' or '+'.\nentrance.length == 2\n0 <= entrance_row < m\n0 <= entrance_col < n\n`maze[entrance_row][entrance_col] == '.'",

It must select and serve the most relevant Ad based on matching criteria, bidding amount, and system constraints while respecting budget constraints.\nDifferent terminology:\nAdvertiser: An entity that publishes advertisements on the platform. Advertisers also keep their advertisement budget on the platform.\nUser: An entity that uses the platform and consumes advertisements with other use cases on the platform.\nBid Amount: Bid amount is the amount earned per advertisement by the platform from the advertiser. If the Bid amount is higher, then there are more chances of the advertisement getting served to the customer.\nAdvertisement Campaign: The Advertiser creates advertisement campaigns on the platform. The advertiser provides info such as URL, content_type (image, video), and bid per Ad. matching, and targeting attributes such as age, interest, and gender, etc., with the campaign.\nSystem Constraints: The Platform will have some constraints and will be checked against all the advertisements before matching.\nAdvertisement Matching: The platform provides advertisements, comparing user details and attributes with all the active campaign requirements. It also compares the bid amount with the existing budget and checks for all the given system constraints for advertisement serving to find the best-matching advertisement. Once an advertisement is served, the budget is reduced from the advertiser’s account. An advertisement is served only when the bid amount is less than the existing budget.\nRequirements P0\nProvide interfaces to add advertisers and their budgets.\nadd_advertiser(name)\nadd_budget(budget)\nProvide interfaces to add users and their attributes to the system, such as date of birth, interests, gender, etc.\nadd_user(user, dob, gender)\nadd_attribbute(attributes)\nProvide an interface to create an advertisement campaign for the advertiser.\ncreate_campaign(advertiser_id, bid_amount, url, type, age, city, constraints)\nProvide an interface to request best best-matching advertisement from the system.

    "description": "Implement a Movie Ticket Booking Application for a Theatre. Refer to the following details:\nA Theatre has Screens that run Shows for different Movies. Each Show has a particular Movie, start time, duration, and is played in a particular Screen in the theatre. Each Screen has an arrangement of Seats that can be booked by Users.\nAssume all Users are registered, authenticated, and logged in to the Application.\nOnce a User selects a particular show to book tickets for, a UserBookingSession starts. Within this UserBookingSession, a User will be able to get the Available Seats for the show and select the Seats he wishes to book. It is a ‘good to have’ for the Application to have limits on the number of seats a User can book in a Ticket.\nOnce the user has selected a group of seats, these seats should become TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE to all other Users.\nThe User then proceeds to make payment which can either be SUCCESS or FAILURE.\nIf Payment FAILED, user can retry Payment for a maximum number of times. Beyond maximum retries, the seats are made AVAILABLE.\nIf Payment SUCCEEDS, Ticket or Booking Confirmation is generated and made available to the User. The UserBookingSession is closed and the Seats are made PERMANENTLY_UNAVAILABLE.\nA User can also explicitly close the UserBookingSession after selecting seats and before making payment. In this case, the seats selected are made AVAILABLE once again.\nDemonstrate the following scenarios:\n2 concurrent Users U1, U2 in the application. The Users can retrieve Available Shows and select one show.\nCase 1:\nSay U1 and U2 select same show.\nU1 requests for and gets all Available Seats for this show.\nU1 selects group of seats and proceeds to pay.\nU2 requests for and gets all Available Seats for this show. U2 should not see the seats selected by U1 as AVAILABLE. 5 .Payment succeeded for U1.\nU1 receives Ticket with Seats confirmed.\nCase 2:\nSay U1 and U2 select same show.\nU1 and U2 requests for and gets all Available Seats for this show.\nU1 selects group of seats.\nU1 proceeds to pay.\nU2 requests for and gets all Available Seats for this show. U2 should NOT see the seats selected by U1 as AVAILABLE.\nPayment failed for U1. Assume maximum retries as zero just for the demo. Also show in another scenario where U1’s UserBookingSession is explicitly closed by U1 before payment is completed.\nU2 again requests for and gets all Available Seats for this show. U2 should now see the seats previously selected by U1 as AVAILABLE.\nCase 3:\nSay U1 and U2 select same show.\nU1 and U2 request for and get all Available Seats for this show.\nU1 selects group of seats and proceeds to pay.\nU2 selects overlapping group of seats and proceeds to pay. U2 should be notified that “one or more of the selected seats are not available at this moment”.\nBonus:\nHave a configurable timeout for a UserBookingSession. Show that if User selects and Payment is not completed by timeout, then the UserBookingSession is closed and the seats selected are made AVAILABLE.\nHandling concurrency in the system so that one seat is not allotted to 2 users if they try to book at the same time.\nExpectations\nCreate the sample data yourself. You can put it into a file, test case or main driver program itself.\nCode should be demo-able. Either by using a main driver program or test cases.\nCode should be modular. Code should have basic OO design. Please do not jam in responsibilities of one class into another.\nCode should be extensible. Wherever applicable, use interfaces and contracts between different methods. It should be easy to add/remove functionality without re­writing entire codebase.\nCode should handle edge cases properly and fail gracefully.\nCode should be legible, readable and DRY\nGuidelines\nUse of DB not expected. You can store data in memory.\nPlease discuss the solution with an interviewer\nPlease do not access internet for anything EXCEPT syntax\nYou are free to use the language of your choice\nAll code should be your own\nPlease focus on the Bonus questions only after ensuring the required features are complete and demoable.",

    "description": "You are given an n x n integer matrix grid where grid[i][j] represents the elevation of cell (i, j) in a 2D landscape.\nThe rain starts to fall, and as time progresses, the water depth increases uniformly across the grid. At any time t, you can only swim into a cell (i, j) if grid[i][j] <= t.\nYou begin at the top-left corner (0, 0) and your goal is to reach the bottom-right corner (n - 1, n - 1). You can move to 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), and can swim infinite distances in zero time as long as you're allowed to enter the next cell.\nYour task is to return the minimum time t at which it is possible to reach the destination.\nExample 1:\nInput: \ngrid = [\n  [0, 2],\n  [1, 3]\n]\n\nOutput: \n3\n\nExplanation  \nAt time 0: You are at (0, 0), but cannot move to (0, 1) because elevation 2 > 0.  \nAt time 1: You can move to (1, 0).  \nAt time 2: You still can’t reach (1,1).  \nAt time 3: All values are ≤ 3, path is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1)  \nMinimum time = 3.\nExample 2:\nInput: \ngrid = [\n  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n  [24,23,22,21,5],\n  [12,13,14,15,16],\n  [11,17,18,19,20],\n  [10,9,8,7,6]\n]\n\nOutput: \n16\n\nExplanation  \nThe path that opens up earliest with lowest peak elevation takes time 16.  \nYou avoid early high elevation values by going around through lower ones.\nConstraints:\nn == grid.length == grid[i].length\n1 <= n <= 50\n0 <= grid[i][j] < n^2\nAll grid[i][j] values are unique\nYou must return the least time t such that you can reach (n-1, n-1) starting from (0, 0)",

A blob here refers to a collection of key-value pairs, where each value is a string. The primary goal is to **compactly serialize** the data and later **restore it accurately**.\n\nThe encoder should take a dictionary or map-like structure and convert it into a single string.\nThe decoder should parse the string and restore the original object, maintaining the integrity of all key-value pairs.\n\nThe encoding scheme must meet the following conditions:\n\n1. It should handle empty strings, special characters (e.g., `=`, `;`, `\\`), and Unicode safely.\n2. Keys and values are both strings. Keys are unique.\n3. The resulting encoded string should be human-readable and compact.\n4. The decode function should be the exact inverse of the encode function.\n\nYou are to implement two functions:\n\n* `encode(blob: Dict[str, str]) -&gt; str`\n* `decode(data: str) -&gt; Dict[str, str]`\n\n###### Example 1:\n```\nInput: \nencode({\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;,\n  &quot;age&quot;: &quot;30&quot;\n})\n\nOutput: \n&quot;name=Alice;age=30&quot;\n\nExplanation  \nEach key-value pair is represented as key=value, and pairs are separated by `;`.\n```\n\n---\n\n###### Example 2:\n\n```\nInput: \nencode({\n  &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Hello=World;&quot;,\n  &quot;lang&quot;: &quot;en;us&quot;\n})\n\nOutput: \n&quot;message=Hello\\=World\\;;lang=en\\;us&quot;\n\nExplanation  \nSpecial characters `=` and `;` are escaped using a backslash `\\`.  \nOriginal data is preserved during decoding.\n```\n\n---\n\n###### Example 3:\n\n```\nInput: \ndecode(&quot;message=Hello\\\\=World\\\\;;lang=en\\\\;us&quot;)\n\nOutput: \n{\n  &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Hello=World;&quot;,\n  &quot;lang&quot;: &quot;en;us&quot;\n}\n\nExplanation  \nAll escape sequences are correctly unescaped to reconstruct original strings.\n```\n\n---\n\n###### Constraints:\n\n* Total number of key-value pairs: `1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^4`\n* Keys are unique, non-empty, and do not contain escape characters (`\\`)\n* Each key and value has length up to `10^4`\n* Must use constant extra space per character during encoding/decoding (no nested parsing libraries) Whatever kind of mentorship session you need.

It is guaranteed that the ID passed to free() was previously allocated.\nYour task is to implement this system efficiently to support multiple allocate and free calls.\nExample 1:\nInput: \nN = 5\nOperations:\nallocate() → 1\nallocate() → 2\nallocate() → 3\nfree(2)\nallocate() → 2\nallocate() → 4\nallocate() → 5\nallocate() → -1\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n3\n2\n4\n5\n-1\nExplanation:\nInitially, IDs 1 through 5 are available.\nallocate() returns 1, 2, 3 sequentially.\nfree(2) makes ID 2 available again.\nThe next allocate() call assigns the smallest available ID, which is 2.\nThe rest are allocated in increasing order.\nOnce all are allocated, any further call returns -1.\nExample 2:\nInput:\nN = 3\nOperations:\nallocate() → 1\nallocate() → 2\nfree(1)\nallocate() → 1\nallocate() → 3\nallocate() → -1\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n1\n3\n-1\nExplanation:\nallocate() gives 1 and 2.\nfree(1) makes 1 available again.\nNext allocation reuses 1, then assigns 3.\nAfter all IDs are in use, return -1 on further allocation.\nConstraints:\n1 <= N <= 10^5\nAt most 10^5 calls to allocate() and free()\nfree(id) is only called for IDs that were previously allocated and not yet freed",

Your task is to determine the maximum subarray sum possible after removing at most K elements from anywhere in the array.\nThe removal of elements can be from any positions, not necessarily consecutive. The remaining elements must form a contiguous subarray for the sum to be considered.\nReturn the maximum possible sum that can be obtained under these conditions.\nExample 1:\nInput:\narr = [1, -2, 0, 3]\nK = 1\n\nOutput:\n4\n\nExplanation:\nWe can remove -2, resulting in the array [1, 0, 3]. The contiguous subarray [1, 0, 3] has a sum of 4, which is the maximum possible sum after removing at most 1 element.\nExample 2:\nInput:\narr = [-1, -1, -1, -1]\nK = 2\n\nOutput:\n-1\n\nExplanation:\nRemoving any two elements still leaves negative numbers. The best sum is obtained by taking a single element -1.\nConstraints:\n1 <= arr.length <= 10^5\n-10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4\n0 <= K < arr.length\nThe subarray after removal must have at least one element.",

At time t, all events with timestamps <= t have taken effect.\nYour task is to return the earliest timestamp at which every user who ever appears in the log becomes connected in a single friendship network. If this never happens, return -1.\nNotes:\nThe log is not a stream; assume the entire list of lines fits in memory.\nMultiple events can share the same timestamp; process all of them for that time.\nNames may appear for the first time late in the log—treat every distinct name as a distinct user.\nDuplicate friendship lines (same pair, any order) have no additional effect.\nExample 1:\nInput: \nlines = [\n  \"455456 Ram became friend to Shyam.\",\n  \"455459 Ramesh became friend to Mahesh.\",\n  \"455465 Moham became friend to Ram.\",\n  \"455489 Shyam became friend to Mahesh.\"\n]\n\nOutput: \n455489\n\nExplanation\nDistinct users are {Ram, Shyam, Ramesh, Mahesh, Moham}.  \nSort by timestamp and union pairs as they occur:\n- 455456: Connect Ram–Shyam.

Components: {Ram, Shyam, Moham}, {Ramesh, Mahesh}\n- 455489: Connect Shyam–Mahesh, which merges the two groups.  \nAll 5 users are connected at 455489, so return 455489.\nExample 2:\nInput: \nlines = [\n  \"10 A became friend to B.\",\n  \"20 C became friend to D.\",\n  \"30 E became friend to F.\"\n]\n\nOutput: \n-1\n\nExplanation\nUsers form separate components {A,B}, {C,D}, {E,F} and never merge into a single connected network.

The system should integrate with multiple third-party payment providers (like banks, card networks, or UPI services) and ensure correctness and fault tolerance.\nKey requirements:\nProcess Payment Requests\nA merchant initiates a payment request with details like userId, merchantId, amount, and paymentMethod.\nThe system should route this request to the appropriate third-party payment provider.\nRetries and Failure Handling\nPayment providers may fail temporarily (e.g., network errors, timeouts).\nYour system should implement retries with backoff strategies.\nIf retries fail, the system should gracefully inform the merchant about failure.\nIdempotency\nMerchants may resend the same payment request due to failures or retries.\nThe system must ensure that the user is not charged multiple times for the same payment.\nIntroduce an idempotency key to handle duplicate requests safely.\nThird-Party Integrations\nThe system should support multiple providers and be able to switch to an alternate provider if the primary one fails.\nResponses from providers must be normalized into a common format before returning to merchants.\nScalability & Reliability\nSystem must handle high transaction volumes (millions of requests per day).\nLogs and audit trails are required for debugging and reconciliation.\nExample 1 (Idempotency Case):\nInput:\nMerchant sends payment request:\n{\n  merchantId: \"M123\",\n  userId: \"U456\",\n  amount: 500,\n  paymentMethod: \"Card\",\n  idempotencyKey: \"abc-123\"\n}\n\nOutput:\n{\n  status: \"SUCCESS\",\n  transactionId: \"T789\",\n  amount: 500\n}\n\nExplanation:\nEven if the merchant retries the request with the same idempotencyKey,\nthe system must return the same transactionId \"T789\" without charging again.\nExample 2 (Provider Failure and Retry):\nInput:\nMerchant sends payment request of amount 1000 through Bank A.\n\nBank A API fails due to timeout.\n\nSystem retries 2 times, still fails.\nSystem switches to Bank B as backup.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  status: \"SUCCESS\",\n  transactionId: \"T902\",\n  amount: 1000,\n  provider: \"BankB\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe system failed over to Bank B after retries on Bank A,\nensuring the payment still succeeds.\nConstraints:\nHandle 10^5+ concurrent requests.\nRetry should be bounded (e.g., max 3 retries with exponential backoff).\nIdempotency must be guaranteed across distributed systems.",

    "description": "You are given a weighted graph of cities (nodes) connected by roads (edges). Two people, A and B, start from two different cities and both need to get to the same destination city. They are allowed to travel independently or to meet at some intermediate city and then continue together toward the destination (if they travel together on a shared road segment they pay that road cost only once for that shared portion). All road costs are non-negative.\nCompute the minimum total cost required for both people to reach the destination city under these rules.\n(Equivalently, choose a meeting city X (which may be one of their start cities or the destination). A travels from A_start to X, B travels from B_start to X, then from X they both travel to dest - the shared final portion X → dest is paid once. Minimize total cost = dist(A_start,X) + dist(B_start,X) + dist(X,dest).)\nInput Format:\nFirst line: two integers n m — number of cities (nodes) and number of roads (edges). Cities are labeled 0 to n-1.\nNext m lines: each line has three integers u v w describing a road between city u and city v with cost w. Roads are undirected. (0 ≤ u,v < n, w ≥ 0)\nLast line: three integers A B dest — starting cities of person A and person B, and the destination city.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer: the minimum total cost for both to reach dest under the sharing rule. If it is impossible for either person to reach dest (so the trip is impossible), print -1.\nExample:\nCity 0 (A’s start) is marked in blue\nCity 2 (B’s start) is marked in green\nCity 5 (Destination) is marked in red\nAll other cities are gray\nEdge weights represent travel costs.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n6 7\n0 1 2\n0 2 5\n1 2 2\n1 3 3\n2 4 2\n3 5 5\n4 5 3\n0 2 5\n\nOutput:\n9\n\nExplanation:\nNodes: 0..5. A starts at 0, B at 2, destination is 5.\nOne optimal meeting city X = 2:\n- A: 0 → 1 → 2 cost = 2 + 2 = 4\n- B: already at 2 cost = 0\n- Shared path: 2 → 4 → 5 cost = 2 + 3 = 5\nTotal = 4 + 0 + 5 = 9.\nNo other meeting point gives lower total cost.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n4 2\n0 1 4\n2 3 6\n0 2 3\n\nOutput:\n-1\n\nExplanation:\nThe graph has two disconnected components. A at 0 and B at 2 need to reach destination 3.\nB can reach 3 (2→3) but A cannot reach 3, so the trip is impossible → output -1.\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5\n0 ≤ m ≤ 5 × 10^5\nEdge costs w are integers with 0 ≤ w ≤ 10^9\n0 ≤ A, B, dest < n\nThe graph is undirected; roads are bidirectional.",

Every part of the path contributes its value not only to itself but also to all of its ancestors in the hierarchy.\nYou need to compute the final total value for every leaf path (a path that does not have any child).\nFor example, in domain-like strings, \"mail.google.com\" has ancestors \"google.com\" and \"com\".

The option can be on or off.\nVisual and UI details\n3.1 The active tab must be visually distinct from inactive tabs.\n3.2 Panels must expand to fit their content while keeping layout stable.\n3.3 Include a visible loading indicator and a visible error message when fetch fails.\n3.4 If tabs are scrollable on small screens ensure the active tab is visible after activation.\nData and API shape examples\n4.1 Example tab item shape for input data for example purposes only\n{ id: \"t1\", title: \"Overview\", content: \"<div>...</div>\" }  \n{ id: \"t2\", title: \"Details\", url: \"/api/details\" }  \n4.2 Make clear how the component receives the data and how it exposes events such as onTabChange or onTabClose.",

The robot does not know the room layout in advance.\nThe robot has the following capabilities through its API:\ninterface Robot {\n  // Returns true if the next cell is open and the robot moves into it.\n  // Returns false if the next cell is blocked and the robot stays in place.\n  boolean move();\n\n  // Turns the robot 90 degrees to the left.\n  void turnLeft();\n\n  // Turns the robot 90 degrees to the right.\n  void turnRight();\n\n  // Cleans the current cell.\n  void clean();\n}\nThe robot can only interact with the environment using the above API. It starts at an unknown position and facing an arbitrary direction.\nYour task is to design an algorithm to ensure that the robot cleans every reachable empty cell in the room.\nInput Format:\nThere is no direct input for the algorithm. The room is modeled internally and hidden from the robot. The robot can only explore it through the given API.\nOutput Format:\nThere is no explicit output.

There are m other creatures at the party (not counting Alice).\nAlice will cut the cake into exactly m + 1 contiguous pieces (a partition of the array into m + 1 subarrays). Each piece’s tastiness is the sum of its sections. She will then give one piece to each of the m creatures and keep the remaining piece for herself. Alice’s piece is allowed to be empty.\nEvery creature is happy only if the tastiness of the piece it receives is at least v. Alice wants to make all creatures happy and, subject to that, maximize the tastiness of her own piece.\nFor each test case, output the maximum tastiness Alice can get.

    "description": "You are given a string s and two integers, minLen and maxLen. Your task is to count the number of 'valid' substrings in s.\nA substring is considered valid if it satisfies two conditions:\nIts length is within the range [minLen, maxLen], inclusive.\nIt does not contain any repeating adjacent characters. For instance, \"aba\" is valid, while \"aab\" is not because of the two adjacent \"a\"s.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains a string s.\nThe second line contains an integer minLen.\nThe third line contains an integer maxLen.\nOutput Format:\nReturn a single integer representing the total count of valid substrings.\nExample 1:\nInput:\ns = \"aabacaba\"\nminLen = 2\nmaxLen = 4\n\nOutput:\n15\n\nExplanation:\nWe need to find all substrings with a length between 2 and 4 that do not have adjacent repeating characters.\n- Valid substrings of length 2: \"ab\", \"ba\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"ab\", \"ba\" (6 total)\n- Valid substrings of length 3: \"aba\", \"bac\", \"aca\", \"cab\", \"aba\" (5 total)\n- Valid substrings of length 4: \"abac\", \"baca\", \"acab\", \"caba\" (4 total)\nThe total count is 6 + 5 + 4 = 15. Substrings like \"aab\" are excluded.\nExample 2:\nInput:\ns = \"zyz\"\nminLen = 1\nmaxLen = 3\n\nOutput:\n6\n\nExplanation:\nAll substrings of \"zyz\" are valid because none have repeating adjacent characters.\n- Length 1: \"z\", \"y\", \"z\" (3 total)\n- Length 2: \"zy\", \"yz\" (2 total)\n- Length 3: \"zyz\" (1 total)\nThe total count is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.\nConstraints:\n1 <= s.length <= 10^5\n1 <= minLen <= maxLen <= s.length\ns consists of lowercase English letters.",
