Your goal is to find all 'magic numbers' that fall within the range from 1 to n, inclusive.\nA number is defined as a 'magic number' if the absolute difference between any two of its adjacent digits is exactly 1. All single-digit numbers (1 through 9) are automatically considered magic numbers.\nFor instance, numbers like 12, 21, and 232 qualify as magic numbers. However, 13 and 245 do not, as the difference between adjacent digits is not 1.\nInput Format:\nA single integer n.\nOutput Format:\nA list of all magic numbers from 1 to n, sorted in ascending order.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n25\n\nOutput:\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 21, 23]\n\nExplanation:\nThese are all the numbers between 1 and 25 that meet the magic number criteria.

    "description": "You are given n players, each holding a unique rank from 1 (the best) to n (the worst). In any match, a player with a better rank (a lower number) will always defeat a player with a worse rank (a higher number).\nYou are also provided with a list of match results. Each result is a pair (a, b), indicating that player a defeated player b.\nYour task is to determine for how many players their exact rank can be precisely identified based on the given match outcomes.\nA player's rank is considered 'determined' if the number of players they are known to be better than, plus the number of players known to be better than them, equals n - 1.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains an integer n, the total number of players.\nThe second line contains an integer m, the number of match results.\nThe next m lines each contain two space-separated integers, winner and loser.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer representing the count of players whose rank can be determined with certainty.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n5\n5\n4 3\n4 2\n3 2\n1 2\n2 5\n\nOutput:\n2\n\nExplanation:\nLet's analyze the relationships:\n- Player 4 beat 3 and 2, 3 beat 2, 1 beat 2, 2 beat 5. \n- Transitive relationships: \n  - 4 beats 3, 2, 5. \n  - 3 beats 2, 5.\n  - 1 beats 2, 5. \n- Player 4 has 3 players they are better than (3, 2, 5) and 0 players they are worse than. Total known relationships = 3. Not enough to determine rank out of 5 players.\n- Player 2 has 1 player they are better than (5) and 3 players they are worse than (4, 3, 1). Total known relationships = 1 + 3 = 4. This is `n-1`, so player 2's rank is determined.\n- Player 5 has 0 players they are better than and 4 players they are worse than (4, 3, 1, 2). Total known relationships = 0 + 4 = 4. This is `n-1`, so player 5's rank is also determined.\n\nOnly players 2 and 5 have a determined rank.

    "description": "You are given a dataset of application versions. Each version is described by its name, a release order, and an operating system (OS) compatibility range defined by a minOS and maxOS. This range is inclusive. The minOS can be negative infinity, and maxOS can be positive infinity, indicating an open-ended range.\nYour task is to create a function that takes a target OS version as input. This function should return the name of the application that supports the target OS and has the highest release order. If multiple applications support the OS, the one with the larger release order is considered \"later\". If no application supports the given OS, you should return a null or equivalent value.\nInput Format:\nA list of application details.

Unlike standard shortest path problems, the weights of the edges can be negative.\nYour task is to find the shortest distance from a given source vertex 'S' to all other vertices in the graph. If a vertex is unreachable from the source, its distance should be considered infinity. The algorithm should also be able to detect if the graph contains a negative-weight cycle, as such a cycle would mean that a shortest path is not well-defined.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers, V (number of vertices) and E (number of edges).\nThe next E lines each contain three space-separated integers u, v, and w, representing a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v with weight w.\nThe last line contains a single integer S, the source vertex.\nOutput Format:\nIf no negative cycle is detected, return a single line containing V space-separated integers, where the i-th integer is the shortest distance from the source S to vertex i. If a vertex is unreachable, represent its distance with a very large number (e.g., 10^9).\nIf a negative cycle is found, return the string \"Negative-weight cycle detected\".\nExample 1:\nInput:\n5 8\n0 1 -1\n0 2 4\n1 2 3\n1 3 2\n1 4 2\n3 2 5\n3 1 1\n4 3 -3\n0\n\nOutput:\n0 -1 2 -2 1\n\nExplanation:\nThe shortest distances from the source vertex 0 to all other vertices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are calculated.

    "description": "You are given a grid of size W x H, representing a city layout. You need to place N office buildings in this grid. Your goal is to find an arrangement of these N buildings such that the maximum distance from any empty lot to its nearest office is minimized. Movement is restricted to four directions (up, down, left, right), and diagonal moves are not allowed. The distance between adjacent cells is 1.\nReturn the minimized maximum distance.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains three integers: W (width), H (height), and N (number of offices).\nOutput Format:\nA single integer representing the minimum possible value for the maximum distance from any lot to the nearest office.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n3 3 1\n\nOutput:\n2\n\nExplanation:\nWith a 3x3 grid and 1 office to place, the optimal position for the office is the center cell (1,1). The lots at the corners are at a distance of 2 from the center (e.g., (0,0) to (1,1) requires one step right and one step down). All other lots are at a distance of 1. The maximum distance is therefore 2. Placing the office anywhere else would result in a maximum distance of 3 or 4.\nConstraints:\n1 <= W, H <= 10\nW * H <= 28\n1 <= N <= 5",

Customers will upload their code and data, specify the required number of GPUs, and set an expected training duration, and our platform schedules, provisions, and runs the job.\nFunctional Requirements:\nJob Submission: Users must be able to upload their code and datasets (as a directory) and specify job parameters like GPU count and maximum runtime.\nResource Allocation: The system must efficiently allocate GPUs to jobs to maximize hardware utilization.\nJob Scheduling: Implement a scheduling strategy that handles job priorities and ensures fairness. For instance, consider factors like waiting time and job size to prevent starvation of large jobs.\nExecution and Monitoring: The platform should manage the lifecycle of concurrent training jobs, track their status (e.g., pending, running, completed, failed), and provide access to logs.\nData Persistence: The user's code and data must be persisted in cloud storage and made available to the training job environment when it runs.\nNon-Functional Requirements:\nScalability: The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent job submissions and scale the GPU cluster as needed.\nReliability: Ensure that jobs are not lost in case of component failures.\nBilling and Monitoring Support: The system should produce logs and metrics sufficient for billing customers based on resource consumption and for internal monitoring.",

Your task is to calculate the maximum index you can reach.\nThe rules for moving from index i to i+1 are as follows:\nFree Move: If the next element array[i+1] is less than or equal to the current element array[i], you can move to the next index without using any resources.\nMove with Resources: If array[i+1] is greater than array[i], you must use one of the following resources to make the move:\nBattery: If the difference array[i+1] - array[i] is less than or equal to your current battery level, you can use the battery. Your battery level will be reduced by this amount.\nSupercharger: If you cannot use the battery (due to insufficient charge) or choose not to, you can use a supercharger, provided you have any left. Using a supercharger does not affect your battery level.\nDetermine the highest index you can successfully reach.\nInput Format:\narray: A list of integers.\nbattery: An integer representing the initial battery capacity.\nsuperchargers: An integer representing the number of available superchargers.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer representing the maximum index reached.\nExample 1:\nInput:\narray = [50, 150, 100, 250, 200, 400, 500, 300, 600]\nbattery = 200\nsuperchargers = 2\n\nOutput:\n7\n\nExplanation:\nA possible path is:\n- Move from index 0 to 1 (50 to 150): The difference is 100. Use 100 from the battery. Remaining battery: 100.\n- Move from 1 to 2 (150 to 100): Free move.\n- Move from 2 to 3 (100 to 250): Difference is 150, which is more than the remaining battery. Use 1 supercharger. Remaining superchargers: 1.\n- Move from 3 to 4 (250 to 200): Free move.\n- Move from 4 to 5 (200 to 400): Difference is 200, which is more than the remaining battery.

Remaining battery: 0.\n- Move from 6 to 7 (500 to 300): Free move.\n- Cannot move from 7 to 8 (300 to 600) as both battery and superchargers are exhausted.\nThe furthest index reached is 7.\nConstraints:\n1 <= array.length <= 10^5\n1 <= array[i] <= 10^9\n0 <= battery <= 10^9\n0 <= superchargers <= array.length",

If t[i] is -1, the node has no time limit; otherwise, you can only visit node i if your current travel time is strictly less than t[i].\nYou start at node 1 at time 0. Your goal is to find the minimum time required to travel from node 1 to every other node in the graph, respecting the time limit constraints.\nReturn an array of size n, where the i-th element is the minimum time to reach node i+1.

    "description": "You are given a string S which consists only of three types of characters: 'A', 'B', and '-'. Your objective is to transform S such that all 'A' characters form a single, contiguous block within the string. You need to achieve this with the minimum possible total cost.\nThere are two types of operations, each with an associated cost:\nMoving an 'A': The cost of moving an 'A' character to a position currently occupied by a '-' (an empty slot) is x.\nConverting a 'B': The cost of converting a 'B' character into a '-' (an empty slot) is y.\nCrucially, an 'A' character cannot be moved directly into a position currently occupied by a 'B'. If an 'A' needs to occupy a slot where a 'B' currently resides, that 'B' must first be converted into a '-' at cost y. After this conversion, the 'A' can then move into the now-empty slot at an additional cost of x. Therefore, the total cost for an 'A' to occupy a spot that was initially a 'B' is x + y.\nYou will be given Q queries. For each query, you will receive a specific pair of costs, x and y. For each query, you must calculate and return the minimum total cost to make all 'A' characters in S contiguous.\nInput Format:\nFirst line: A string S (length N).\nSecond line: An integer Q, representing the number of queries.\nNext Q lines: Each line contains two space-separated integers, x and y, for the current query.\nOutput Format:\nFor each query, output a single integer representing the minimum cost.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nA-BA-BA\n1\n1 2\n\nOutput:\n8\nConstraints:\n1 <= N, Q <= 10^5\nS consists only of characters 'A', 'B', '-'\n0 <= x, y <= 10^9",

    "description": "A robot is placed in a rectangular maze. The maze is represented by a 2D matrix where each cell can be one of three types:\n#: A wall, which the robot cannot pass through.\n.: An empty cell, which the robot can move into.\nE: An escape point, where the robot successfully exits the maze.\nThe robot is \"blind\" and can move in four directions: Right (R), Up (U), Left (L), Down (D). It does not know its current position or the layout of the maze. Your task is to devise a universal sequence of commands (e.g., \"DRR\", \"RU\") such that no matter which valid empty cell the robot starts from, if it executes this sequence of commands, it will eventually reach an 'E' (escape point) and exit the maze.\nThe robot executes commands one by one. If a command attempts to move the robot into a wall, the robot simply stays in its current cell but the command is still considered executed. The robot can exit the maze early if it reaches an 'E' at any point during the command execution, even if the command sequence is not fully completed.\nYour goal is to find any such sequence of commands. An optimal solution would aim for the shortest possible command sequence.\nInput Format:\nThe input will be a 2D matrix representing the maze.\nThe first line contains two integers R and C, representing the number of rows and columns of the maze.\nThe next R lines each contain a string of C characters, where each character is '#', '.', or 'E'.\nOutput Format:\nA single string representing the universal command sequence.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n4 5\n#####\n#...#\n#..E#\n#####\n\nOutput:\nDRR\n\nExplanation:\nLet's trace from all possible starting points:\n- From (1,1) (top-left '.'):\n  - D: moves to (2,1)\n  - R: moves to (2,2)\n  - R: moves to (2,3) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\n- From (1,2):\n  - D: moves to (2,2)\n  - R: moves to (2,3) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\n- From (1,3):\n  - D: moves to (2,3) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\n- From (2,1):\n  - D: hits wall, stays at (2,1)\n  - R: moves to (2,2)\n  - R: moves to (2,3) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\n- From (2,2):\n  - D: hits wall, stays at (2,2)\n  - R: moves to (2,3) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\n- From (2,3) ('E'): Robot already at escape point, implicitly escapes.\nThe sequence \"DRR\" ensures escape from all valid starting points.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n4 4\n####\n#.E#\n##.#\n####\n\nOutput:\nRU\n\nExplanation:\nLet's trace from all possible starting points:\n- From (1,1) (top-left '.'):\n  - R: moves to (1,2) which is 'E'.

Agent A begins at the root node and moves downwards towards leaves. Agent B begins at a specified leaf node and moves upwards towards the root.\nBoth agents move one step per unit of time. The scoring rules for Agent A are as follows:\nIf a node is visited by Agent B first, Agent A receives 0 points for that node.\nIf a node is visited by Agent A first, Agent A receives the full value of that node.\nIf both agents visit the same node at the same unit of time, Agent A receives half the value of that node (use integer division if applicable).\nYour task is to calculate the maximum total points Agent A can collect, assuming Agent A chooses its downward path optimally to maximize its score, knowing Agent B's path is fixed from the specified leaf to the root.\nInput Format:\nThe tree structure will be provided, including node values. The starting leaf node for Agent B will also be specified.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer representing the maximum points Agent A can collect.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nTree Structure (simplified representation):\n        10 (root)\n       /  \\\n      5    8\n     / \\\n    3   6 (B starts here)\nNode Values: 10, 5, 8, 3, 6\nStarting Leaf for B: Node 6\n\nOutput:\n18\n\nExplanation:\nAssume B's path is fixed from Node 6 upwards: 6 (Time 0) -> 5 (Time 1) -> 10 (Time 2).\n\nAgent A starts at Root Node 10 (Time 0).\n\nPossible paths for A to maximize points:\n1.

The boundaries of the map (i.e., cells outside the grid) are also considered blockers.\nYou are also given a query array [dist_left, dist_top, dist_bottom, dist_right]. Each dist_X value specifies the minimum required distance from a robot to the closest blocker in that cardinal direction.\nFor a robot located at (R, C), calculate the actual distance to the closest blocker in each of the four cardinal directions. The distance is defined as the number of cells traversed (including empty 'E' cells) to reach the first 'X' or map boundary.\nA robot satisfies the query if its actual distance to the closest blocker in each direction is greater than or equal to the corresponding value in the query array.\nYour task is to return the coordinates [row, col] of all robots that satisfy the given query.\nInput Format:\nA 2D character array locationMap (rows x cols).\nA 1D integer array query of length 4, [dist_left, dist_top, dist_bottom, dist_right].\nOutput Format:\nA list of lists (or array of arrays) where each inner list [row, col] represents the coordinates of a robot satisfying the query.

The component should render page numbers based on the current page and the total number of pages, following these rules:\nAlways show the first page, the last page, the current page, the page immediately before the current page, and the page immediately after the current page.\nIf there is a gap between displayed page numbers, replace the gap with an ellipsis (…).\nInput Format:\nTwo integers separated by a space: currentPage totalPages\ncurrentPage – the page that is currently active (1‑based index).\ntotalPages – the total number of pages available.\nOutput Format:\nA single line containing the pagination view. Page numbers and ellipses are separated by a single space.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n1 10\n\nOutput:\n1 2 … 10\nExplanation The current page is 1, so we show page 1, page 2, an ellipsis for the gap, and the last page 10.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n5 10\n\nOutput:\n1 … 4 5 6 … 10\nExplanation Pages 4, 5, and 6 surround the current page 5. Gaps before 4 and after 6 are represented by ellipses.\nExample 3:\nInput:\n9 10\n\nOutput:\n1 … 8 9 10\nExplanation The current page is near the end, so we show the last three pages and an ellipsis for the earlier gap.\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ totalPages ≤ 10^5\n1 ≤ currentPage ≤ totalPages",

    "description": "You are given a forest – a collection of one or more rooted trees. Each node i has an integer rating r_i. You may start at any node and travel along the edges of a tree, never revisiting a node, forming a simple path. The length of a path is the number of nodes it contains. Given an integer K, find the maximum possible sum of ratings among all simple paths in the entire forest whose length does not exceed K.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains two space‑separated integers N and K – the total number of nodes in the forest and the maximum allowed path length.\nThe second line contains N space‑separated integers r_1, r_2, …, r_N – the rating of each node (1‑based indexing).\nThe third line contains an integer M – the number of undirected edges. The next M lines each contain two integers u and v indicating an edge between node u and node v. The given edges form a forest (no cycles).\nOutput Format:\nA single integer – the maximum sum of ratings of any simple path whose length is at most K.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n7 3\n5 -2 3 4 1 -1 2\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n5 6\n5 7\nOutput:\n12\nExplanation The forest consists of one tree rooted at node 1.

    "description": "You are given a collection of N boxes. Each box i has three positive integers: height h_i, width w_i and depth d_i.\nYou may place a box on top of another box only if both its width and depth are strictly smaller than the width and depth of the box below it. The boxes cannot be rotated (the orientation given in the input must be kept). Your task is to arrange a subset of the boxes in a stack that satisfies the above rule and yields the greatest possible total height.\nInput Format:\nFirst line: an integer N – the number of boxes.\nThe next N lines: each line contains three space‑separated integers h_i w_i d_i representing the height, width and depth of the i‑th box.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer – the maximum achievable stack height.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n5\n4 6 7\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n10 12 15\n2 3 4\n\nOutput:\n21\nExplanation\nOne optimal stack is:\nBox 4 (10 × 12 × 15) → Box 1 (4 × 6 × 7) → Box 5 (2 × 3 × 4). The total height is 10 + 4 + 2 = 16.\nThe maximum height achievable with the given boxes is 21 by stacking Box 4 → Box 1 → Box 3 → Box 5 → Box 2, giving 10 + 4 + 4 + 2+ 1 + 2 =21\nExample 2:\nInput:\n3\n5 5 5\n3 4 6\n2 2 2\n\nOutput:\n7\nExplanation Box 1 cannot be placed on any other box because its width and depth are not smaller than any other box. The best stack is Box 2 (3 × 4 × 6) placed on top of Box 3 (2 × 2 × 2), giving a total height of 3 + 2 = 5. However, Box 1 alone gives height 5, and stacking Box 1 on top of Box 2 is invalid. The maximum achievable height is 7 by stacking Box 1 (5) on top of Box 3 (2).\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ N ≤ 100\n1 ≤ h_i, w_i, d_i ≤ 10⁴\nAll dimensions are integers.\nBoxes cannot be rotated; orientation is fixed.\nStacking rule: for a box placed on top, its width < width of box below and its depth < depth of box below.",

    "description": "You are given a single English sentence. Design a simple scoring function that evaluates the sentence based on three factors:\nWord Count – each word contributes 1 point.\nAverage Word Length – compute the average length of all words (ignoring punctuation) and add the floor of this value to the score.\nVowel Bonus – each vowel (a, e, i, o, u, case‑insensitive) adds 2 points.\nThe final score is the sum of the three contributions.\nInput Format:\nA single line containing the sentence. The sentence may include letters, spaces, and punctuation characters (.,!?:;). Words are sequences of alphabetic characters separated by spaces or punctuation.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer – the computed score of the sentence.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nHello, world!\n\nOutput:\n13\nExplanation The sentence has 2 words → 2 points. Word lengths are 5 and 5, average = 5 → floor(5) = 5 points. Vowels are e, o, o → 3 vowels × 2 = 6 points. Total = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13. (Since punctuation is ignored, the correct total is 13; the example output reflects the intended calculation.)\nExample 2:\nInput:\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n\nOutput:\n34\nExplanation There are 9 words → 9 points. Total letters = 35, average length = 35/9 ≈ 3.88 → floor = 3 points. Vowels = 11 → 11 × 2 = 22 points. Total = 9 + 3 + 22 = 34. (The example output shows the intended final score after applying the same rules.)\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ length of sentence ≤ 10^5 characters\nSentence contains printable ASCII characters only\nProcessing must run in O(n) time where n is the length of the input",
