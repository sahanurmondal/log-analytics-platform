    "description": "Write a function to decode a string based on a specific encoding rule. Each encoded segment of the string is presented in the format: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is repeated exactly k times. k is always a positive integer. The function should return the decoded version of the string.\nThe input string is valid, with no extra whitespaces and correctly formed brackets. Note that digits in the string are only used to indicate the number of times the strings within the brackets should be repeated, and they do not appear in the original unencoded string segments. The challenge includes handling nested encoded segments.\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"3[p]2[qr]\"\nOutput: \"pppqrqr\"\n\nExplanation: \"3[p]\" means \"ppp\", and \"2[qr]\" means \"qrqr\". Together they form \"pppqrqr\".\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"2[p4[q]]\"\nOutput: \"pqqqqpqqqq\"",

    "description": "Design a data structure that combines the functionality of a map and list, allowing for efficient key-value mapping as well as retrieval of the nth inserted key-value pair. The data structure should support the following operations:\nadd(key, value): Adds a new key-value pair to the structure. If the key already exists, update its value.\ngetByKey(key): Retrieves the value associated with the given key.\ngetByIndex(index): Retrieves the nth key-value pair added to the map, based on insertion order.\nThis structure should optimize for both key-based access and order-based access of elements, making it suitable for scenarios where both types of access are frequently needed.\nExample 1:\nInput\nadd(\"apple\", 10), add(\"banana\", 20), getByKey(\"apple\"), getByIndex(1)\n\nOutput\n10, (\"banana\", 20)\n\nExplanation\n\"apple\" maps to 10. The first element added was \"apple\", and the second was \"banana\". getByIndex(1) returns \"banana\" and its value 20.\nExample 2:\nInput\nadd(\"cat\", 30), add(\"dog\", 40), add(\"cat\", 50), getByKey(\"cat\"), getByIndex(0)\nOutput\n50, (\"cat\", 50)\nExplanation\nInitially, \"cat\" maps to 30, but it is updated to 50. \"cat\" is the first element added, so getByIndex(0) returns \"cat\" and its updated value 50.",

Each package may have dependencies that need to be built before it can be built. The function should utilize a given API, getDependencies(Package packageName), which returns a set of immediate dependencies for a specified package. The build order should list packages in the order in which they can be safely built, ensuring that all dependencies of a package are built before the package itself.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nPackage Name: A\nDependencies: \nA → {B,C},\nB → {E},\nC → {D,E,F},\nD → {},\nF → {},\nG → {C}\n\nOutput:\n[E, B, F, D, C, A]\n\nExplanation:\nThe package A depends on B and C.

    "description": "Given an array task_memory, representing the memory requirements for each task, and another array task_type, representing the type of each task, along with an integer max_memory which is the maximum memory the server can use to process two tasks concurrently, your function should calculate the minimum amount of time required to process all tasks. Each task requires 1 unit of time to process. The server can process two tasks at the same time only if:\nThey are of the same type.\nTheir combined memory usage does not exceed max_memory.\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 4, task_memory = [7, 2, 3, 9], task_type = [1, 2, 1, 3], max_memory = 10\nOutput: 3\n\nExplanation:\n- Tasks 0 (type 1, memory 7) and 2 (type 1, memory 3) can be processed together in 1 unit of time because their combined memory (10) matches the max_memory limit.\n- Task 1 (type 2, memory 2) and Task 3 (type 3, memory 9) must be processed separately, taking 1 unit of time each due to differing types and exceeding memory constraints.\nThus, the total time required is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 units.",

The same number may be chosen from the candidates array an unlimited number of times. You may return the combinations in any order.\nEach combination is unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.\nThe test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum to target is less than 150 combinations.\nExample 1:\nInput: candidates = [2, 3, 6, 7], target = 7\nOutput: [[2, 2, 3], [7]]\nExplanation:\n- 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Since 2 can be used multiple times, this is a valid combination.\n- 7 is itself a candidate, so it forms a combination as well.\nExample 2:\nInput: candidates = [2, 3, 5], target = 8\nOutput: [[2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 3, 3], [3, 5]]\nExplanation:\n- Multiple combinations can sum up to 8:\n  - 2 + 2 + 2 + 2\n  - 2 + 3 + 3\n  - 3 + 5\nExample 3:\nInput: candidates = [2], target = 1\nOutput: []\nExplanation:\n- There are no combinations that can sum to 1 since 2 is the smallest element in the candidates array.\nConstraints:\n1 <= candidates.length <= 30\n2 <= candidates[i] <= 40\nAll elements of candidates are distinct.\n1 <= target <= 40",

    "description": "PhonePe processes a vast number of transactions every day, wherein some transactions may fail (enter a FAILED state) or remain in a PENDING state due to various reasons such as bank or NPCI issues, or internal PhonePe errors. To handle such cases efficiently, a resolution system is needed, where customers can log their unsuccessful transactions and raise complaints against them. The system must categorize customer issues into several types, such as payment-related, mutual fund-related, gold-related, or insurance-related. Different customer service agents will have their specific expertise based on the issue type, whom the system will assign the issues by marking them waiting in case all agents are busy. The customer service agents can work on one issue at a time and update its status, and once it is resolved, the agent will receive another issue.\nThe solution should incorporate the following features:\nCustomers can log a complaint against any unsuccessful transaction.\nCustomer Service Agents can search for customer issues with issue ID or customer details (email).\nAgents can view their assigned issues and mark them resolved once they are resolved.\nSystem should assign the issue to agents based on an assigning strategy.\nSystem should allow the admin to onboard new agents.\nSystem should allow the admin to view the agent's work history.\nImplementation requirements\nYour solution should implement the following functions. Feel free to use the representation for objects you deem fit for the problem and the provided use cases. The functions are ordered in the decreasing order of importance (highest to lowest). We understand that you may not be able to complete the implementation for all the functions listed here. So try to implement them in the order in which they are declared down below.\ncreateIssue(transactionId, issueType, subject, description, email)\naddAgent(agentEmail, agentName ,List<issueType>)\nassignIssue(issueId) // -> Issue can be assigned to the agents based on different strategies. For now, assign to any one of the free agents.\ngetIssues(filter) // -> issues against the provided filter\nupdateIssue(issueId, status, resolution)\nresolveIssue(issueId, resolution)\nviewAgentsWorkHistory() // -> a list of issue which agents worked on\nExample:\ncreateIssue(\"T1\", \"Payment Related\", \"Payment Failed\", \"My payment failed but money is debited\", \"testUser1@test.com\");\n>>> Issue I1 created against transaction \"T1\"\n\ncreateIssue(\"T2\", \"Mutual Fund Related\", \"Purchase Failed\", \"Unable to purchase Mutual Fund\", \"testUser2@test.com\");\n>>> Issue I2 created against transaction \"T2\"\n\ncreateIssue(\"T3\", \"Payment Related\", \"Payment Failed\", \"My payment failed but money is debited\", \"testUser2@test.com\");\n>>> Issue I3 created against transaction \"T3\"\n\n\naddAgent(\"agent1@test.com\", \"Agent 1\", Arrays.asList(\"Payment Related\", \"Gold Related\"));\n>>> Agent A1 created\n\naddAgent(\"agent2@test.com\", \"Agent 2\", Arrays.asList(\"Payment Related\"));\n>>> Agent A2 created\n\n\nassignIssue(\"I1\")\n>>> Issue I1 assigned to agent A1\n\nassignIssue(\"I2\")\n>>> Issue I2 assigned to agent A2\n\nassignIssue(\"I3\")\n>>> Issue I3 added to waitlist of Agent A1\n\n\ngetIssue({\"email\": \"testUser2@test.com\"});\n>>> I2 {\"T2\", \"Mutual Fund Related\", \"Purchase Failed\", \"Unable to purchase Mutual Fund\", \"testUser2@test.com\", \"Open\"},\n I3 {\"T3\", \"Payment Related\", \"Payment Failed\", \"My payment failed but money is debited\", , \"testUser2@test.com\", \"Open\"}\n\ngetIssue({\"type\": \"Payment Related\"});\n>>> I1{\"T1\", \"Payment Related\", \"Payment Failed\", \"My payment failed but money is debited\", \"testUser1@test.com\", \"Open\"},\n I3 {\"T3\", \"Payment Related\", \"Payment Failed\", \"My payment failed but money is debited\", \"testUser1@test.com\", \"Open\"}\n\n\nupdateIssue(\"I3\", \"In Progress\", \"Waiting for payment confirmation\");\n>>> I3 status updated to In Progress\n\n\nresolveIssue(\"I3\", \"PaymentFailed debited amount will get reversed\");\n>>> I3 issue marked resolved\n\n\nviewAgentsWorkHistory()\n>>> A1 -> {I1, I3}, \n    A2 -> {I2}",

    "description": "Write code for design of Battleship Game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)\nRules of the Game\nThere are 2 players in the game.\nEach Person has two boards, one where he places his own ships, one where he tracks the missiles he has fired. Each board is of size 10x10.\nEach person can place 5 ships on his board\nCarrier of length 5\nBattleship of length 4\nCruiser of length 3\nSubmarine of length 3\nDestroyer of length 2\nPlayers take a turn to fire missiles at the opposing player. If the missile hits a ship, then the opposing player informs the initial mover of a hit, else he says it’s a miss. If all the spots on a ship are hit, then ship is sunk.\nThe first player to sink all 5 ships of the opposing player wins the game.\nThis is the view of one player\nLeft-hand side is the ships as placed by the player. Red spots represent where the enemy successfully struck the player’s ships.\nWhite/Green spots are where the enemy player missed.\nThe right-hand side is where the player has launched missiles against the enemy.\nThe player has sunk 3 of the enemy ship.\nBonus Requirement:\nYou don’t need to code this up, but explain how will you extend your design to allow people to play over the network (p2p without having a central server).\nGuidelines\nWe will be looking for the Low-Level Design including good class structure, entities and how they interact, good abstraction, good separation of concerns, etc\nYou will need to code the “Game Loop”.\nYou don’t need to bother with the code that “draws” the game or UI interactions, you can mock the function for eg. “drawBoard(List<Ship> ships)” and assume it draws the board with the ships on it. You can also assume a “takeInput(Player player)” function that gets the play that the current player wishes to make.\nBonus: Take the input from the console. For eg. player can say “Fire C5” and you fire a missile at C5 or “Draw Board” and you print the current state of the board to the player.\nYou can choose any language, however, it needs to be a runnable code.\nAssumptions\nPlease make the required assumptions, for instance, players can only join before the game starts, but MAKE SURE YOU LIST THEM IN A README FILE along with the code.",

For example, a book by Rowling would have ROW1234 as a unique Id. Also, note that the library can have more than one copy for a book.\nRegister and unregister users in the Library\nReservation Management system: A user should be able to make a request to borrow a book from the library.\nUsers can borrow books by the book id (eg - ROW1234). For the scope of problems, let's assume users are aware of book id’s.\nIf the book is available and not borrowed by anyone, it should be reserved to the member’s name.\nIf the book is already borrowed by another user, the reservation system must add the requesting member to a FIFO waitlist of reservations. When the book is returned to the library, it will not be marked as available and will be available only to the first user under the FIFO queue\nIf the user is the first user of the FIFO waitlist, the book can be reserved under the user’s name\nFine calculation system: A user is allowed to borrow a book only for 14 days. If this time limit is exceeded at the time of return, the system should calculate a fine of 20 rupees per day for the number of days delay.\nGood To Have (Bonus):\nOne user should only be allowed to reserve one copy of the book\nAuditing: Design should cater to following use cases:\nGiven a bookId, give a list of users having that book\nGiven a userId, list of books issued to him\nOther details:\nUse of a DB is not allowed. We are expecting in-memory data structures to support the application.\nExpectations:\nFunctionally correct code (whatever feature is completed)\nCreate the sample data yourself. You can put it into a file, test case or main driver program itself. Unit test cases are not expected.\nCode should be demo-able.\nCode should be modular. Code should have basic OO design. Please do not jam the responsibilities of one class into another.\nCode should be extensible. Wherever applicable, use interfaces and contracts between different methods. It should be easy to add/remove functionality without re-writing the entire codebase.\nCode should handle edge cases properly and fail gracefully.\nCode should be legible and readable.\nCLI, Web based application, REST API and UI are not expected.\nGuidelines:\nPlease discuss the solution with an interviewer\nPlease do not access internet for anything EXCEPT syntax\nYou are free to use the language of your choice\nAll work should be your own\nPlease focus on the Bonus Feature only after ensuring the required features are complete and demoable.",

Your task is to determine the minimum total cost (i.e., sum of the weights of the selected edges) required to \"cut\" the tree such that all leaf nodes become disconnected from the root.\nCutting an edge means removing that edge from the tree. When an edge is cut, all nodes in the subtree rooted at the child of that edge become disconnected from the root. Your goal is to choose a set of edges to cut such that after the removals, there is no path from the root to any leaf, and the total cost is minimized.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains an integer N representing the number of nodes in the tree.\nThe following N-1 lines each contain three integers u, v, w, meaning there is an edge between node u and node v with weight w.\n(It is guaranteed that the given edges form a valid tree with node 1 as the root.)\nOutput Format:\nPrint a single integer representing the minimum cost required to disconnect all leaves from the root.\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5\n0 ≤ w ≤ 10^4\nExample:\nInput:\n4\n1 2 5\n1 3 1\n2 4 10\n\nOutput:\n6\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe binary tree structure is as follows:\n     1\n    / \\\n   2   3\n  /\n 4\n\nTotal cost = 5 + 1 = 6.",

In other words, if a message with the same content appears within 10 seconds of its first appearance, only the first occurrence should be kept. However, if the same message appears after 10 seconds have passed since its last occurrence, it should be considered a new occurrence and be included.\nFunction Specification:\nImplement the following function:\nList<Message> filterMessages(List<Message> messages);\nInput: A list of Message objects.\nOutput: A list of Message objects, filtered such that for each unique message content, only the first occurrence is kept within any 10-second window.\nAssumptions:\nThe receivedTime is given in seconds.\nThe list of messages may or may not be sorted by receivedTime. (If not, you may choose to sort the messages based on receivedTime before processing.)\nDuplicate messages are determined solely based on the content field.\nOnly duplicates that occur within 10 seconds after the first occurrence should be removed.\nExample:\nSuppose you have the following list of messages:\nMessage(\"Hello\", 5)\nMessage(\"Hi\", 6)\nMessage(\"Hello\", 10)\nMessage(\"Hello\", 17)\nMessage(\"Hi\", 12)\nProcessing:\n\"Hello\" at time 5 is the first occurrence, so keep it.\n\"Hi\" at time 6 is the first occurrence, so keep it.\n\"Hello\" at time 10 is a duplicate within 10 seconds of the first \"Hello\" (5 + 10 = 15), so discard it.\n\"Hello\" at time 17 is after 10 seconds have passed since the first \"Hello\", so it is a new occurrence and should be kept.\n\"Hi\" at time 12 is a duplicate within 10 seconds of the first \"Hi\" (6 + 10 = 16), so discard it.\nExpected Output:\n[\n  Message(\"Hello\", 5),\n  Message(\"Hi\", 6),\n  Message(\"Hello\", 17)\n]\nAdditional Challenge (Follow-up):\nRemove all the duplicates within 10 seconds even the first message shouldn't be present",

    "description": "There are N blocks, numbered from 0 to N−1, arranged in a row. A couple of frogs were sitting together on one block when they had a terrible quarrel. Now they want to jump away from one another so that the distance between them will be as large as possible. The distance between blocks numbered J and K, where J≤K, is computed as K−J+1. The frogs can only jump up, meaning that they can move from one block to another only if the two blocks are adjacent and the second block is of the same or greater height as the first. What is the longest distance that they can possibly create between each other, if they also chose to sit on the optimal starting block initially?\nWrite a function:\nfunction solution (blocks);\nthat, given an array blocks consisting of N integers denoting the heights of the blocks, returns the longest possible distance that two frogs can make between each other starting from one of the blocks.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nGiven blocks =[2,6,8,5], \n\nOutput:\nthe function should return 3 . \n\nExplanation:\nIf starting from blocks[0], the first frog can stay where it is and the second frog can jump to blocks[2] (but not to blocks[3]). blocks [2] (but not to blocks[3]). \n**Example 2: **\nInput:\nGiven blocks =[1,5,5,2,6], \n\nOutput:\nthe function should return 4 \n\nExplanation:\nIf starting from blocks[3], the first frog can jump to blocks[1], but not blocks[0], and the second frog can jump to blocks[4]. \nExample 3:\nInput:\nGiven blocks =[1,1]\n\nOutput:\nthe function should return 2 \n\nExplanation:\nIf starting from blocks[1], the first frog can jump to blocks[0] and the second frog can stay where it is.

If starting from blocks[1], the first frog can jump to blocks[0] and the second frog can stay where it is.

    "description": "Design and implement a user journey service for monitoring users as they navigate through various use cases. This will be a rule-based journey framework where a user will onboard a journey and move along various stages on the basis of specific conditions.\nRequirements:\nJourney:\njourney is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents a predefined path to track a user on.\nA journey consists of 'n' stages, and users must complete specific actions/events to advance to the next stage.\nMultiple users can onboard to the same journey.\nA user can onboard a journey only once.\nThere will be complete isolation across different journeys i.e. anything in one journey won’t depend on any other journey.\nourneys can be of 2 types, time-bound (having a start-date, end-date) and perpetual (no validity and will remain live till it’s active).\nFirst stage in the journey will be the onboarding stage, middle stages will be the onward stages and the final stage will be the terminal stage. We will have to mark the journey as active for it to be picked as part of the evaluation. By default on journey creation, it should be inactive. Also when the validity period of a journey is over, mark it inactive for time-bound journeys. Example:\nThere are 2 Journeys: J1 : Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3. Onboarding step for Stage 1 is login. For stage 2 is user opening recharge page and Stage 3 is user doing a recharge transaction\nJ2: Stage 1 -> Stage 2. Onboarding step is the user opening an upi lite account. For stage 2 is the user doing a top up on their upi lite account.\nLet's say there are 3 users: User 1: Logins to the app, hence is on stage 1 of J1. User opens the recharge page, at this time the user moves to stage 2 of J1. User 2: Logins to the app, hence is on stage 1 of J1. User opens the recharge page, at this time the user moves to stage 2 of J1 and then does a recharge transaction and is finally moved to stage 3 of J1 User 3: Logins to the app, hence is on stage 1 of J1. User opens up an upi account and is onboarded to J2.\nSo at this point of time, User 1 is at stage 2 of J1, User 2 is at stage 3 of J1 and User 3 is at stage 1 of J1 and stage 1 of J2.\nMandatory Implementations:\ncreateJourney(Journey journey) This will help in creating a journey in the system.\nupdateState(String JourneyId, boolean active) Mark journey as active/inactive.\ngetJourney(String journeyId) To get the journey details\nevaluate(String userId, Payload payload) Input payload can contain some fixed params and a Map of <key, value> Basis the payload, 3 things may happen:\nThe payload may match the condition for onboarding the user to a journey. In this case, the user will get onboarded to the journey. The payload may match the condition required for moving to the next stage for a user already onboarded on a specific stage. In this case, the user will move to the next stage in that journey. The payload will not match any condition, in this case it will be simply ignored. Users onboarding/transitions in a journey will happen only when the journey is ACTIVE.\ngetCurrentStage(String userId, String journeyId) Find the current stage of a user in the given journey id.\nisOnboarded(String userId, String journeyId) Return true/false basis on the condition that whether the user is part of the journey or not.\nOptional 1: Provide a way where we can send SMS to a user as soon as any stage transition happens for that user (onboarding to the journey or moving from one stage to another). It should have the capability to decide for which stage we want to provide this feature.\nOptional 2: Add support for recurring journeys, where a single user can onboard the journey multiple times.\nWhy the journey service?\nThis service serves as a platform for creating multiple journeys for different user paths and tracking users along the journey, taking business decisions accordingly in real time without the need of heavy database queries. Additionally, the service can trigger actions when users transition between stages or remain stationary at a particular stage for an extended period. For example, it can send notifications to users who have viewed a product but haven't made a purchase.\nSystem Architecture:\nImagine all the events of the entire product systems flowing to some message queue, and the journey service acting as one of the consumers of the messages. All the messages flowing in are being evaluated (as per the evaluate(String userId, Payload payload)) and this service keeping track of the user and journey status for real time use case by different product systems using getCurrentStage(String userId, String journeyId)\nPoints to note:\nYour code should cover all the mandatory functionalities explained above. Your code should be executable and clean. All necessary validations must be present. In case of an exception, proper errorCode must be present. Store the data in-memory for journeys and the user-transitions within the journey.",

And at any point the system can be asked how many entities are in-progress (or in-flight). The system is expected to give this count, as fast as possible\nProblem Statement:\nYou need to design a system that is able to track pending entities.\nAn entity is identified using a unique ID and a list of hierarchical tags.\nThere are 3 parts to this problem statement. startTracking, endTracking and getCounts.\nWhen an entity is being tracked, you will be provided with an identifier for the entity, and a hierarchical tags associated with the entity to be tracked.\nWhen counts are being retrieved, you will be provided with a partial list of tags, for which the accumulated counts need to be returned. This partial list of tags will follow the same hierarchy order as given in the input. (Should become clear with the example shown below).\nThe following is a guide for the interfaces you may have in your system.\nAn interface to start tracking the counts for the entity. (increment count by 1)\nvoid startTracking (Integer id, List<String> hierarchicalTags);\nwhere,\nid = Identifier of the entity\nhierarchicalTags = Tags that are properties of the entity. These tags are hierarchical in nature.\n\nAn interface to stop tracking the entity that is already being tracked (reduce count by 1)\nvoid stopTracking (Integer id);\nwhere,\nid = Identifier of the transaction\n\nAn interface to get counts of entity being tracked, that match the tags supplied\nInteger getCounts (List<String> tags);\nwhere,\ntags = a hierarchy of tags, for which counts are to be retrieved\nSample: The following is just a sample for your understanding.\nPlease remember: You are expected to write the system which mirrors production quality code, rather than just implementing these functions\nThe sample below shows the ability to track in-flight transactions happening across instruments, states and cities:\nExamples for tracking and getting counts\nstartTracking(1112, [\"UPI\", \"Karnataka\", \"Bangalore\"]); \nstartTracking(2451, [\"UPI\", \"Karnataka\", \"Mysore\"]); \nstartTracking(3421, [\"UPI\", \"Rajasthan\", \"Jaipur\"]); \nstartTracking(1221, [\"Wallet\", \"Karnataka\", \"Bangalore\"]); \n\ngetCounts([\"UPI\"])   # represents the counts of all pending \"UPI\" transactions\nOutput: 3\ngetCounts([\"UPI\", \"Karnataka\"])  # represents the counts of all pending \"UPI\" transactions in \"Karnataka\"\nOutput: 2\ngetCounts([\"UPI\", \"Karnataka\", \"Bangalore\"]) # represents the counts of all pending \"UPI\" transactions in \"Karnataka\" and \"Bangalore\"\nOutput: 1\n\ngetCounts([\"Bangalore\"]) # Does not represent a valid hierarchy in the sample\nOutput: 0\n\nstartTracking(4221, [\"Wallet\", \"Karnataka\", \"Bangalore\"]); \nstopTracking(1112); \nstopTracking(2451); \n\ngetCounts([\"UPI\"])\nOutput: 1\ngetCounts([\"Wallet\"])\nOutput: 2\ngetCounts([\"UPI\", \"Karnataka\", \"Bangalore\"])\nOutput: 0",

No account can contain balance less than 0.\nRequirements\nThe smallest amount that the users can transfer is F₹ 0.0001. The description of the wallet operations follows.\nThe command CreateWallet creates a new wallet with a balance of F₹ in the name of .\nThe command TransferMoney would decrease F₹ from accountHolder1’s account and add the same amount in accountHolder2’s account.\nThe command Statement should display the account statement for accountHolder1’s account. The account statement should contain all the transactions made in that account.\nThe command Overview should display the current balance of all the accounts.\nYour wallet system also provides some offers to the customers.\nOffer 1: When customer A transfers money to customer B and both the account holders have the same balance after the transaction then both the customers get F₹ 10 as a reward.\nOffer 2: Whenever the command Offer2 is fired 3 customers with the highest number of transactions will get F₹ 10, F₹ 5, and F₹ 2 as rewards. If there is a tie (customers having the same number of transactions) then the customer having higher account balance should be given preference. If there is still a tie then the customer whose account was created first should be given preference.\nBonus\nAdd a command called FixedDeposit <fd_amount>. Whenever the command is fired an amount equal to <fd_amount> is parked for . If for the next 5 transactions the account balance for that remains above <fd_amount> the gets F₹ 10 as interest. If the account balance goes below <fd_amount> then the FD should be dissolved and the user would need to give the FixedDeposit command again to start a new FD.\nAs an added bonus display the <fd_amount> and remaining transactions in the Overview and Statement command also.\nSample\nInput:\nCreateWallet Harry 100\nCreateWallet Ron 95.7\nCreateWallet Hermione 104\nCreateWallet Albus 200\nCreateWallet Draco 500\nOverview\n\nOutput:\nHarry 100\nRon 95.7\nHermione 104\nAlbus 200\nDraco 500\n\nInput:\nTransferMoney Albus Draco 30\nTransferMoney Hermione Harry 2\nTransferMoney Albus Ron 5\nOverview\n\nOutput:\nHarry 112\nRon 100.7\nHermione 112\nAlbus 165\nDraco 530\n\nInput:\nStatement Harry\n\nOutput:\nHermione credit 2\nOffer1 credit 10\n\nInput:\nStatement Albus\n\nOutput:\nDraco debit 30\nRon debit 5\n\nInput:\nOffer2\nOverview\n\nOutput:\nHarry 114\nRon 100.7\nHermione 112\nAlbus 175\nDraco 535\nNotes\nCode should be demo-able\nCode should be modular\nInput can be taken from command line or file or by hard coding a single string in your code\nYou are expected to find and handle all corner cases and data validations\nAll data should be stored in memory.

This requires 2 operations.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: One way to make the array alternating is by converting it to [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2]. This requires 1 operation.\nConstraints:\n1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵\n1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁵",

    "description": "You are provided with a collection of movies, each characterized by its name and rating. Additionally, there are bi-directional similarity relationships between certain pairs of movies, indicating that if Movie A is similar to Movie B, then Movie B is also similar to Movie A. This similarity is transitive; for instance, if Movie A is similar to Movie B, and Movie B is similar to Movie C, then Movie A is also considered similar to Movie C.\nYour task is to develop an algorithm that, given a specific movie and an integer N, identifies the top N movies that are most similar to the given movie, ranked by their ratings in descending order.\nInput:\nA list of movies, where each movie is represented as a tuple containing:\nname: A string representing the movie's name.\nrating: An integer representing the movie's rating.\nA list of similarity relationships, where each relationship is represented as a tuple containing two movie names that are similar to each other.\nA query consisting of:\nmovieName: A string representing the name of the reference movie.\nN: An integer specifying the number of top-rated similar movies to retrieve.\nOutput:\nA list of up to N movie names that are similar to the given movieName, sorted by their ratings in descending order. If multiple movies have the same rating, they should be ordered alphabetically by their names. If there are fewer than N similar movies, return all of them.\nExample:\nMovies:\n[\n  (\"Movie A\", 6),\n  (\"Movie B\", 7),\n  (\"Movie C\", 8),\n  (\"Movie D\", 9),\n  (\"Movie E\", 5)\n]\n\nSimilarities:\n[\n  (\"Movie A\", \"Movie B\"),\n  (\"Movie B\", \"Movie C\"),\n  (\"Movie C\", \"Movie D\"),\n  (\"Movie A\", \"Movie E\")\n]\n\nQuery:\n(\"Movie A\", 2)\n\nOutput:\n[\"Movie D\", \"Movie C\"]\nExplanation:\nIn this example, the similarity relationships form the following connections:\nMovie A is similar to Movie B and Movie E.\nMovie B is similar to Movie C.\nMovie C is similar to Movie D.\nThrough transitivity, all movies (A, B, C, D, E) are similar to each other. Among these, excluding \"Movie A\" itself, the top 2 movies with the highest ratings are:\nMovie D with a rating of 9.\nMovie C with a rating of 8.\nTherefore, the output is [\"Movie D\", \"Movie C\"].\nConstraints:\nThe number of movies will not exceed 10,000.\nMovie ratings are integers between 1 and 10.\nN is a positive integer.\nEach movie has a unique name.",
