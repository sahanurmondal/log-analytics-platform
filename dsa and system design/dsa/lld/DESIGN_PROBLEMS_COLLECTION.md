## Problem-Solving Approach for Design Problems

### 1. Requirements Clarification
- **Functional Requirements**: What operations should the system support?
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, scalability, memory constraints
- **Edge Cases**: Handle invalid inputs, empty data structures
- **Scale**: Expected number of operations, data size

### 2. Design Considerations
- **Data Structure Choice**: Arrays, hashmaps, trees, heaps
- **Time Complexity**: For each operation (get, put, delete)
- **Space Complexity**: Memory usage optimization
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access considerations

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- **Core Data Structures**: Choose appropriate underlying structures
- **Helper Methods**: Break down complex operations
- **Invariants**: Maintain data structure properties
- **Optimization**: Lazy evaluation, caching, amortized analysis

### 4. Common Design Patterns
- **Cache Design**: LRU/LFU eviction policies
- **Iterator Pattern**: Traversing complex data structures
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven updates
- **Factory Pattern**: Creating different object types
- **Singleton Pattern**: Global state management
