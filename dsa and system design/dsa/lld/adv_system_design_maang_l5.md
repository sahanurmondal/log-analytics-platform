# Advanced System Design Topics for MAANG SDE L5/L6 Interviews

This guide covers advanced system design topics crucial for SDE interviews at MAANG companies (L5/L6 level). Each topic includes a detailed explanation, use cases, anti-patterns, alternatives, and common interview questions.

---

## 1. Log-Structured Merge Trees (LSM Trees)
**Explanation:** LSM Trees optimize write-heavy workloads by batching writes in memory (memtables) and periodically merging them to disk (SSTables). This design reduces random disk writes and is used in modern NoSQL databases (e.g., Cassandra, LevelDB, RocksDB). Compaction merges and sorts data, improving write throughput but potentially impacting read latency.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Write Request] --> B(MemTable/In-Memory Buffer)
  B --> C{Flush Trigger}
  C -- No --> B
  C -- Yes --> D(SSTable on Disk)
  D --> E[Compaction]
  E --> D
```
**Real-World Example:** Cassandra uses LSM trees to handle massive write loads for time-series data.
**When to Use:** High write throughput, append-only workloads, time-series data, write-optimized storage.
**When Not to Use:** Read-heavy workloads, low-latency random reads, small datasets.
**Alternatives:** B+ Trees, in-memory databases, columnar stores.
**Anti-Patterns:** Using LSM trees for workloads with frequent random reads or updates can degrade performance due to compaction overhead.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How does compaction work in LSM trees?
  - *Answer:* Compaction in LSM trees is the process of merging smaller, sorted files (SSTables) into larger ones, removing deleted or duplicate entries and maintaining sorted order. This reduces storage usage and improves read performance by minimizing the number of files to search. Compaction can be triggered periodically or based on thresholds.
- What are the trade-offs between LSM and B+ trees?
  - *Answer:* LSM trees are optimized for write-heavy workloads, as they batch writes in memory and write sequentially to disk, reducing random I/O. However, they can suffer from higher read amplification and compaction overhead. B+ trees, on the other hand, provide better read performance and are suitable for read-heavy workloads but can be less efficient for high write rates due to random disk writes.
- How do LSM trees handle deletions and updates?
  - *Answer:* Deletions and updates in LSM trees are handled by writing tombstone markers or new values to the memtable. The actual removal of deleted data occurs during compaction, when tombstones are processed and obsolete entries are purged from disk.
- What is write amplification in LSM trees, and how can it be mitigated?
  - *Answer:* Write amplification refers to the phenomenon where a single logical write results in multiple physical writes due to compaction. It can be mitigated by tuning compaction strategies, using larger SSTables, or employing tiered compaction to reduce the frequency of merges.
- How do LSM trees impact read latency, and what techniques can optimize reads?
  - *Answer:* LSM trees can increase read latency because data may be spread across multiple SSTables. Techniques like Bloom filters, block caches, and hierarchical indexes help optimize reads by quickly filtering out irrelevant files and reducing disk I/O.

## 2. Bloom Filters
**Explanation:** Probabilistic data structure for fast membership checks with space efficiency. False positives possible, but no false negatives. Used to avoid unnecessary disk lookups.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph LR;
  A[Input Element] --> B[Hash Functions]
  B --> C[Bit Array]
  C --> D{All Bits Set?}
  D -- Yes --> E["Possibly in Set"]
  D -- No --> F["Definitely Not in Set"]
```
**Real-World Example:** Used in HBase and Cassandra to check if a key might exist before disk access.
**When to Use:** Caching, distributed systems, database indexing, network security.
**When Not to Use:** When false positives are unacceptable, exact membership required.
**Alternatives:** Hash sets, Cuckoo filters.
**Anti-Patterns:** Using Bloom filters for security-critical checks where false positives are unacceptable.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How do you tune the false positive rate in a Bloom filter?
  - *Answer:* The false positive rate is tuned by adjusting the size of the bit array and the number of hash functions. More bits and more hash functions reduce the false positive rate but increase memory usage and computation.
- What happens when a Bloom filter becomes full?
  - *Answer:* As more elements are added, the probability of false positives increases. A "full" Bloom filter will return true for almost all queries, making it ineffective. At this point, a new filter should be created or a scalable variant used.
- How do you delete elements from a Bloom filter?
  - *Answer:* Standard Bloom filters do not support deletion. Counting Bloom filters, which use counters instead of bits, allow decrementing counters to support deletions.
- What are the trade-offs of using a Bloom filter?
  - *Answer:* Bloom filters are space-efficient and fast but allow false positives and do not support deletions (unless using a counting variant). They are not suitable when exact membership is required.

## 3. Cache Eviction Policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO)
**Explanation:** Strategies to remove items from cache when full. LRU removes least recently used, LFU least frequently used, FIFO oldest. Choice impacts cache hit ratio and system performance.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Cache] -->|Full| B{Eviction Policy}
  B -- LRU --> C[Remove Least Recently Used]
  B -- LFU --> D[Remove Least Frequently Used]
  B -- FIFO --> E[Remove Oldest]
```
**Real-World Example:** Redis supports LRU and LFU eviction policies for memory management.
**When to Use:** Memory-constrained environments, web servers, databases, CDN edge nodes.
**When Not to Use:** When all items are equally important, or cache churn is high.
**Alternatives:** Random eviction, ARC, custom policies.
**Anti-Patterns:** Using LRU in workloads with cyclic access patterns can lead to cache thrashing.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How would you implement an LRU cache?
  - *Answer:* An LRU cache can be implemented using a combination of a hash map for O(1) access and a doubly linked list to track the order of usage. When an item is accessed, it is moved to the front of the list. When the cache is full, the least recently used item (at the end of the list) is evicted.
- When is LFU better than LRU?
  - *Answer:* LFU is better when frequently accessed items should be retained regardless of recency, such as in workloads with a small set of hot items accessed repeatedly over time. LRU is better for workloads with temporal locality.
- What are the trade-offs of FIFO vs. LRU?
  - *Answer:* FIFO is simpler but may evict frequently used items if they were added early. LRU is more complex but better retains recently used items, improving hit rates for workloads with temporal locality.
- How do you prevent cache thrashing?
  - *Answer:* Use a larger cache size, tune eviction policies, or use adaptive policies like ARC to reduce the impact of cyclic access patterns.

## 4. Concurrency Control (Optimistic, Pessimistic)
**Explanation:** Techniques to manage simultaneous access to shared resources. Optimistic assumes minimal conflict, Pessimistic locks resources. Used in databases and distributed systems to ensure consistency.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Transaction Start] --> B{Type}
  B -- Optimistic --> C[Read/Write, Validate at Commit]
  B -- Pessimistic --> D[Acquire Lock, Read/Write, Release Lock]
```
```
**Real-World Example:** Databases like PostgreSQL use MVCC (optimistic), while MySQL InnoDB supports row-level locking (pessimistic).
**When to Use:** Multi-user systems, databases, distributed transactions.
**When Not to Use:** Single-user systems, low contention environments.
**Alternatives:** MVCC, timestamp ordering, two-phase locking.
**Anti-Patterns:** Overusing pessimistic locks can lead to deadlocks and reduced throughput.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How do you prevent deadlocks?
  - *Answer:* Deadlocks can be prevented by acquiring locks in a consistent order, using lock timeouts, or employing deadlock detection algorithms that identify and resolve cycles in the wait-for graph.
- What is the difference between optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control?
  - *Answer:* Optimistic concurrency control assumes conflicts are rare and checks for conflicts only at commit time, rolling back if necessary. Pessimistic control locks resources before access, preventing conflicts but potentially reducing concurrency.
- When would you use one over the other?
  - *Answer:* Use optimistic control in low-contention environments where conflicts are rare and high concurrency is desired. Use pessimistic control when conflicts are frequent or data integrity is critical.
- How does MVCC relate to optimistic concurrency?
  - *Answer:* MVCC is a form of optimistic concurrency control that allows multiple versions of data, enabling non-blocking reads and reducing contention between readers and writers.

## 5. Change Data Capture (CDC)
**Explanation:** Captures and propagates changes in data sources to downstream systems in real time. Used for event-driven architectures and data replication. CDC can be log-based, trigger-based, or query-based.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Database] -- Change --> B[CDC Engine]
  B --> C[Message Queue]
  C --> D[Consumers]
```
```
**Real-World Example:** Debezium streams changes from MySQL/PostgreSQL to Kafka for real-time analytics.
**When to Use:** Real-time analytics, microservices, data lakes, ETL pipelines.
**When Not to Use:** Simple batch jobs, when latency is not critical.
**Alternatives:** Polling, event sourcing, triggers.
**Anti-Patterns:** Using CDC for high-frequency changes without proper backpressure can overwhelm consumers.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How does log-based CDC work?
  - *Answer:* Log-based CDC reads the database's transaction log to capture changes (inserts, updates, deletes) as they happen, ensuring minimal impact on the source database and providing a reliable, ordered stream of changes.
- What are the challenges in ensuring exactly-once delivery with CDC?
  - *Answer:* Challenges include handling failures, deduplication, and ensuring idempotency. Systems must track offsets or transaction IDs and use transactional messaging or idempotent consumers to avoid duplicates.
- How do you handle schema changes in CDC?
  - *Answer:* Schema changes can be handled by versioning events, updating downstream consumers, and using schema registries to manage and propagate changes safely.
- What are the trade-offs between trigger-based and log-based CDC?
  - *Answer:* Trigger-based CDC is easier to implement but can add overhead to the source database and miss some changes. Log-based CDC is more efficient and reliable but requires access to internal database logs and more complex setup.

## 6. Distributed Locking
**Explanation:** Ensures mutual exclusion across distributed systems. Common implementations use Redis (Redlock), Zookeeper, or etcd. Critical for leader election and resource coordination.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Client 1] --> B[Lock Service]
  A2[Client 2] --> B
  B -- Grant Lock --> A
  B -- Deny Lock --> A2
```
```
**Real-World Example:** Redis Redlock algorithm for distributed locks in microservices.
**When to Use:** Leader election, resource coordination, job scheduling.
**When Not to Use:** Single-node systems, stateless operations.
**Alternatives:** Local locks, database row locks, optimistic concurrency.
**Anti-Patterns:** Relying on distributed locks for high-frequency, low-latency operations can introduce bottlenecks.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How does the Redlock algorithm work?
  - *Answer:* Redlock acquires locks on a majority of independent Redis nodes, using timeouts and unique tokens to ensure only one client holds the lock. If a client fails to acquire the lock on a majority, it releases any partial locks.
- What are the failure modes in distributed locking?
  - *Answer:* Failure modes include network partitions, node failures, and clock drift. These can lead to split-brain scenarios or lock loss, so systems must handle retries and lock expiration.
- How do you prevent split-brain scenarios?
  - *Answer:* Use quorum-based locking, short lock timeouts, and ensure that only a majority of nodes can grant a lock. Monitor for network partitions and design for safe lock recovery.
- When should you avoid distributed locks?
  - *Answer:* Avoid distributed locks for high-frequency, low-latency operations or when stateless, idempotent designs are possible, as locks can become a bottleneck or single point of failure.

## 7. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
**Explanation:** Ensures durability by logging changes before applying them. Used in databases and file systems for crash recovery and ACID compliance.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Transaction] --> B[WAL Log]
  B --> C[Data Files]
  C --> D[Commit]
```
```
**Real-World Example:** PostgreSQL uses WAL for transaction durability and crash recovery.
**When to Use:** Transactional systems, crash recovery, ACID compliance.
**When Not to Use:** Non-critical data, stateless services.
**Alternatives:** Journaling, shadow paging.
**Anti-Patterns:** Not flushing WAL to disk before acknowledging success can lead to data loss.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How does WAL ensure durability?
  - *Answer:* WAL ensures durability by writing changes to a persistent log before applying them to the main data files. If a crash occurs, the log can be replayed to recover committed transactions.
- What is the difference between WAL and journaling?
  - *Answer:* WAL logs changes before they are applied, while journaling typically logs the intent to change. WAL is more granular and is used for databases, while journaling is common in file systems.
- How do you optimize WAL performance?
  - *Answer:* Use sequential disk writes, group commits, and fast storage (e.g., SSDs). Tune flush intervals and batch writes to balance durability and throughput.
- What are the risks of not syncing WAL to disk?
  - *Answer:* If WAL is not flushed to disk before acknowledging a transaction, a crash can result in data loss or inconsistency.

## 8. Consensus Algorithms (Raft, Paxos)
**Explanation:** Achieve agreement among distributed nodes. Raft is easier to implement; Paxos is more theoretical. Used for leader election, configuration management, and distributed databases.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Leader Election] --> B[Leader]
  B --> C[Followers]
  C --> D[Log Replication]
  D --> E[Consensus]
```
```
**Real-World Example:** etcd and Consul use Raft for distributed consensus.
**When to Use:** Distributed databases, leader election, configuration management.
**When Not to Use:** Single-node systems, non-critical coordination.
**Alternatives:** Gossip protocols, eventual consistency.
**Anti-Patterns:** Using consensus for non-critical or high-frequency operations can reduce system throughput.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How does Raft achieve consensus?
  - *Answer:* Raft elects a leader, which receives all client requests and replicates log entries to followers. Once a majority acknowledge an entry, it is committed. Followers apply entries in order, ensuring consistency.
- What are the failure scenarios in Paxos?
  - *Answer:* Paxos can handle node failures and message loss, but progress may stall if a majority of nodes are unavailable. Split-brain and network partitions can delay consensus.
- When would you use Raft over Paxos?
  - *Answer:* Raft is preferred for practical systems due to its understandability and easier implementation. Paxos is more general but harder to implement correctly.
- What is log replication in Raft?
  - *Answer:* The leader appends entries to its log and sends them to followers. Once a majority have written the entry, it is committed and applied to the state machine.

## 9. Sharding and Partitioning
**Explanation:** Splits data across multiple servers for scalability. Sharding uses keys; partitioning can be range, hash, or list-based. Enables horizontal scaling but introduces complexity in cross-shard queries.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Incoming Data] --> B{Shard Key}
  B -- Key 1 --> C[Shard 1]
  B -- Key 2 --> D[Shard 2]
  B -- Key N --> E[Shard N]
```
```
**Real-World Example:** MongoDB uses sharding for large-scale data distribution.
**When to Use:** Large datasets, high throughput, geographic distribution.
**When Not to Use:** Small datasets, complex cross-shard queries.
**Alternatives:** Vertical scaling, replication.
**Anti-Patterns:** Poor shard key selection can lead to hotspots and uneven data distribution.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How do you choose a shard key?
  - *Answer:* Choose a key that distributes data and load evenly across all shards, avoiding hot spots. Good candidates are user IDs, hashes, or composite keys.
- What are the challenges with cross-shard transactions?
  - *Answer:* Cross-shard transactions require coordination between multiple shards, increasing complexity, latency, and the risk of partial failures or inconsistencies.
- How do you rebalance shards?
  - *Answer:* Rebalancing involves moving data from overloaded shards to underutilized ones, updating routing metadata, and ensuring minimal downtime or impact on availability.
- What are the trade-offs of range vs. hash partitioning?
  - *Answer:* Range partitioning allows efficient range queries but can lead to hot spots. Hash partitioning distributes load evenly but makes range queries less efficient.

## 10. Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
**Explanation:** Maintains multiple versions of data for concurrent access. Used in PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc. Enables non-blocking reads and high concurrency.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Write Txn] --> B[Version 1]
  A2[Write Txn 2] --> C[Version 2]
  D[Read Txn] -->|Sees| B
  E[Read Txn 2] -->|Sees| C
```
```
**Real-World Example:** PostgreSQL uses MVCC to allow readers and writers to operate without blocking each other.
**When to Use:** High concurrency, long-running transactions, read-heavy workloads.
**When Not to Use:** Simple systems, low concurrency.
**Alternatives:** Two-phase locking, timestamp ordering.
**Anti-Patterns:** Not cleaning up old versions (vacuuming) can lead to storage bloat.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How does MVCC prevent read-write conflicts?
  - *Answer:* MVCC provides each transaction with a snapshot of the database at a point in time. Writers create new versions, so readers never block writers and vice versa, preventing conflicts.
- What is snapshot isolation?
  - *Answer:* Snapshot isolation means each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the data as of its start time, preventing dirty reads and non-repeatable reads.
- How are old versions cleaned up?
  - *Answer:* Old versions are removed by a background process (e.g., vacuuming in PostgreSQL) once no active transactions need them.
- What are the trade-offs of MVCC?
  - *Answer:* MVCC improves concurrency and read performance but increases storage usage and requires periodic cleanup of old versions.

## 11. Distributed Caching
**Explanation:** Caches data across multiple nodes to reduce latency and load. Examples: Redis Cluster, Memcached. Improves scalability and fault tolerance.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[App Server] --> B[Cache Node 1]
  A --> C[Cache Node 2]
  A --> D[Cache Node N]
  B & C & D --> E[Database]
```
```
**Real-World Example:** Twitter uses distributed caching to serve timelines at scale.
**When to Use:** High-traffic web apps, microservices, session storage.
**When Not to Use:** Small-scale apps, when consistency is critical.
**Alternatives:** Local cache, CDN, database cache.
**Anti-Patterns:** Not handling cache invalidation can lead to stale data.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How do you ensure cache consistency across nodes?
  - *Answer:* Use cache invalidation protocols (e.g., write-through, write-behind, or pub/sub for invalidation), consistent hashing, and versioning to keep data synchronized. For strong consistency, use distributed locks or consensus.
- What are the trade-offs of distributed vs. local caching?
  - *Answer:* Distributed caching improves scalability and fault tolerance but adds network latency and complexity. Local caching is faster but can lead to stale data and is less scalable.
- How do you handle cache failures?
  - *Answer:* Use fallback to the database, implement cache replication, and monitor cache health. Design for graceful degradation and avoid single points of failure.
- What is cache stampede and how do you prevent it?
  - *Answer:* Cache stampede occurs when many clients request the same missing key simultaneously. Prevent it with request coalescing, locking, or pre-warming hot keys.

## 12. Rate Limiting
**Explanation:** Controls request rates to protect services. Token bucket, leaky bucket, and fixed window are common algorithms. Prevents abuse and ensures fair resource usage.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[User Requests] --> B[Rate Limiter]
  B -->|Allowed| C[Service]
  B -->|Blocked| D[Error/Retry]
```
```
**Real-World Example:** API gateways like Kong and AWS API Gateway implement rate limiting for public APIs.
**When to Use:** API gateways, public APIs, resource protection.
**When Not to Use:** Internal services, predictable load.
**Alternatives:** Throttling, backpressure, quotas.
**Anti-Patterns:** Setting rate limits too low can block legitimate users; too high can allow abuse.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How does the token bucket algorithm work?
  - *Answer:* The token bucket algorithm allows requests as long as tokens are available in the bucket. Tokens are added at a fixed rate, and each request consumes a token. If the bucket is empty, requests are limited or delayed, allowing for bursts up to the bucket size.
- How do you implement distributed rate limiting?
  - *Answer:* Use a centralized store (e.g., Redis) to track tokens or counters across nodes, or use distributed algorithms like consistent hashing and gossip to synchronize state. Ensure atomic updates to avoid race conditions.
- What are the trade-offs of different rate limiting algorithms?
  - *Answer:* Token bucket allows bursts, leaky bucket smooths traffic, and fixed window is simple but can cause spikes at window boundaries. Choose based on traffic patterns and fairness requirements.
- How do you handle rate limit errors gracefully?
  - *Answer:* Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 429), include retry-after headers, and provide clear error messages to clients.

## 13. Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Explanation:** Prevents system overload by blocking calls to failing services. Allows recovery and fallback. Protects systems from cascading failures.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Service Call] --> B{Circuit State}
  B -- Closed --> C[Call Service]
  B -- Open --> D[Fail Fast/Fallback]
  B -- Half-Open --> E[Test Call]
```
```
**Real-World Example:** Netflix Hystrix implements circuit breakers for microservices resilience.
**When to Use:** Microservices, external API calls, unreliable dependencies.
**When Not to Use:** Simple monoliths, critical operations without fallback.
**Alternatives:** Timeouts, retries, bulkhead pattern.
**Anti-Patterns:** Not resetting the circuit breaker can cause permanent service unavailability.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How does a circuit breaker transition between states?
  - *Answer:* A circuit breaker starts in the closed state, allowing calls. If failures exceed a threshold, it opens, blocking calls. After a timeout, it enters half-open, allowing limited test calls. If successful, it closes; if not, it reopens.
- What is the difference between circuit breaker and retry logic?
  - *Answer:* Retry logic attempts failed calls again, while a circuit breaker blocks calls to a failing service to prevent overload. Circuit breakers protect systems from cascading failures, retries can exacerbate them if not controlled.
- How do you test circuit breaker effectiveness?
  - *Answer:* Simulate failures, monitor state transitions, and verify fallback logic. Use metrics to track open/close events and ensure the system recovers as expected.
- When should you use a circuit breaker?
  - *Answer:* Use circuit breakers when calling unreliable or slow dependencies, especially in distributed systems where failures can cascade.

## 14. Bulkhead Pattern
**Explanation:** Isolates resources to prevent one failing component from affecting others. Limits concurrent calls per resource. Improves system resilience.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Requests] --> B[Bulkhead 1]
  A --> C[Bulkhead 2]
  B --> D[Service 1]
  C --> E[Service 2]
```
```
**Real-World Example:** Thread pools in Java limit the impact of slow tasks on overall system throughput.
**When to Use:** Shared resources, critical/non-critical operation separation.
**When Not to Use:** Simple apps, well-segregated infrastructure.
**Alternatives:** Thread pools, connection pools, semaphores.
**Anti-Patterns:** Not tuning bulkhead limits can lead to resource starvation or underutilization.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How do you implement the bulkhead pattern?
  - *Answer:* Use separate thread pools, queues, or connection pools for different resources or service areas. This ensures that if one pool is exhausted, it does not affect others.
- What are the trade-offs of bulkheads vs. circuit breakers?
  - *Answer:* Bulkheads isolate failures to specific components, while circuit breakers block calls to failing services. Bulkheads prevent resource exhaustion, circuit breakers prevent cascading failures. Both can be used together for resilience.
- When would you use bulkheads in microservices?
  - *Answer:* Use bulkheads when services share critical resources (e.g., database connections) or when you want to isolate critical and non-critical operations to prevent one from starving the other.
- How do you tune bulkhead limits?
  - *Answer:* Monitor resource usage and adjust pool sizes based on load patterns, criticality, and desired isolation. Use metrics to detect saturation or underutilization.

## 15. Blue-Green Deployment
**Explanation:** Maintains two production environments for zero-downtime deployments and quick rollback. Reduces deployment risk and enables fast recovery.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Users] --> B{Router}
  B -- Blue --> C[Blue Env]
  B -- Green --> D[Green Env]
```
**Real-World Example:** E-commerce platforms use blue-green deployments to avoid downtime during major releases.
**When to Use:** Critical systems, zero-downtime requirements, fast rollback.
**When Not to Use:** Resource-constrained environments, simple apps.
**Alternatives:** Canary deployment, rolling updates, feature toggles.
**Anti-Patterns:** Not synchronizing databases between blue and green environments can cause data inconsistency.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How do you switch traffic between blue and green environments?
  - *Answer:* Use a load balancer or DNS switch to redirect user traffic from the blue environment to the green environment (or vice versa) after verifying the new version is healthy.
- What are the risks of blue-green deployment?
  - *Answer:* Risks include data drift if databases are not synchronized, increased infrastructure costs, and potential for user confusion if sessions are not migrated.
- How do you handle database migrations?
  - *Answer:* Use backward-compatible migrations, apply schema changes before switching, and ensure both environments can operate with the new schema during the transition.
- When would you prefer blue-green over canary deployment?
  - *Answer:* Prefer blue-green when you need instant rollback and can afford duplicate environments, or when you want to minimize exposure to new changes.

## 16. Canary Deployment
**Explanation:** Gradually rolls out changes to a subset of users before full deployment. Reduces risk and enables real-world testing.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Users] --> B{Traffic Split}
  B -- Canary --> C[New Version]
  B -- Rest --> D[Old Version]
```
**Real-World Example:** Google uses canary releases for new features in Gmail and Search.
**When to Use:** Feature testing, risk minimization, performance testing.
**When Not to Use:** Features that can't be partially deployed, fast rollout needed.
**Alternatives:** Blue-green deployment, A/B testing, feature toggles.
**Anti-Patterns:** Not monitoring canary users can lead to undetected issues.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How do you select canary users?
  - *Answer:* Select a representative sample of users based on demographics, usage patterns, or other criteria.
- What metrics do you monitor during a canary release?
  - *Answer:* Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, error rate, and user satisfaction.
- How do you automate rollback?
  - *Answer:* Implement automated rollback scripts that can be triggered based on certain conditions (e.g., high error rate, user complaints).
- When would you prefer canary deployment over blue-green?
  - *Answer:* Prefer canary deployment when you want to test a new feature with a small subset of users before rolling it out to all users, or when you want to minimize risk and impact on users.

## 17. Event Sourcing
**Explanation:** Stores state changes as a sequence of events. Enables audit trails and state reconstruction. Useful for complex business logic and debugging.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Command] --> B[Event Store]
  B --> C[Event Stream]
  C --> D[Rebuild State]
```
**Real-World Example:** Event sourcing is used in financial systems for transaction auditing.
**When to Use:** Audit requirements, complex business logic, debugging.
**When Not to Use:** Simple CRUD apps, high query performance needed.
**Alternatives:** CDC, traditional persistence.
**Anti-Patterns:** Not handling event versioning can break state reconstruction.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How do you rebuild state from events?
  - *Answer:* Use event sourcing frameworks like Apache Kafka or Apache Flink to replay events and reconstruct state.
- What are the challenges of event sourcing?
  - *Answer:* Event sourcing can be complex and requires careful handling of event ordering and consistency.
- How do you handle event schema evolution?
  - *Answer:* Use versioning strategies like semantic versioning or event-driven migrations to handle changes to event schemas.
- When would you prefer event sourcing over CDC?
  - *Answer:* Prefer event sourcing when you need to maintain a complete history of state changes, or when you want to support complex business logic and debugging.

## 18. Feature Toggles
**Explanation:** Enables/disables features via configuration without redeploying code. Supports gradual rollouts and A/B testing. Useful for experimentation and emergency disables.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[User Request] --> B[Feature Toggle Config]
  B -- On --> C[New Feature]
  B -- Off --> D[Old Feature]
```
**Real-World Example:** Facebook uses feature toggles to test new features with a subset of users.
**When to Use:** Gradual rollouts, canary releases, emergency disables.
**When Not to Use:** Long-term feature differentiation, rarely changed toggles.
**Alternatives:** Branch deployments, versioned APIs.
**Anti-Patterns:** Leaving toggles in code long-term can increase technical debt.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How do you manage toggle configuration at scale?
  - *Answer:* Use a centralized configuration management system like HashiCorp Consul or Apache Zookeeper.
- What are the risks of feature toggles?
  - *Answer:* Risks include data inconsistency if toggles are not applied consistently, increased complexity in code, and potential for bugs if toggles are not properly tested.
- How do you ensure toggle cleanup?
  - *Answer:* Implement automated tests to verify that toggles are not left in the codebase after they are no longer needed.
- When would you prefer feature toggles over branching?
  - *Answer:* Prefer feature toggles when you want to test small changes quickly without creating a new branch, or when you want to avoid the overhead of branching.

## 19. Consistent Hashing
**Explanation:** Distributes data across nodes with minimal rebalancing. Used in distributed caches and storage. Reduces impact of node addition/removal.

**Diagram:**
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Hash Ring] --> B[Node 1]
  A --> C[Node 2]
  A --> D[Node N]
  E[Data Item] -->|Hash| A
```
**Real-World Example:** Amazon Dynamo uses consistent hashing for partitioning.
**When to Use:** Distributed caching, CDNs, sharded databases.
**When Not to Use:** Static node sets, small-scale systems.
**Alternatives:** Modulo-based sharding, range partitioning.
**Anti-Patterns:** Not using virtual nodes can lead to uneven data distribution.
**Common Interview Questions:**
- How does consistent hashing handle node failures?
  - *Answer:* Consistent hashing rebalances data across nodes when a node is added or removed, minimizing the impact on the overall system.
- What are virtual nodes?
  - *Answer:* Virtual nodes are replicas of a physical node that are evenly distributed across the hash ring. This allows for more even distribution of data and load.
- How do you rebalance data?
  - *Answer:* When a node is added or removed, consistent hashing rebalances data by moving data from the affected node to the new node.
- When would you use consistent hashing over other hashing schemes?
  - *Answer:* Use consistent hashing when you need to distribute data evenly across nodes, or when you want to minimize the impact of node addition/removal.

## 20. Service Mesh
**Explanation:** Infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication, security, and observability. Examples: Istio, Linkerd. Provides traffic management, security, and monitoring.

**Diagram:**
