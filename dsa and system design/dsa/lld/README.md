## How to Use

1. **Start with TOP_100_LLD_PROBLEMS.md** - This contains the complete list of 100 problems with detailed descriptions
2. **Choose problems based on your interview needs** - Different companies focus on different aspects
3. **Practice implementation** - Code the solutions in your preferred programming language
4. **Review design decisions** - Understand the trade-offs and alternatives

## Interview Tips

1. **Understand the problem** before jumping into implementation
2. **Ask clarifying questions** about requirements and constraints
3. **Start with basic design** then add complexity
4. **Consider trade-offs** between different approaches
5. **Think about scalability** and maintainability
6. **Write clean, readable code** with proper abstractions
7. **Test your design** with edge cases and scenarios
