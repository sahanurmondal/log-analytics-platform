## System Architect Mindset

### Decomposing Requirements

**1. The RITE Framework**
- **Requirements**: Clarify functional and non-functional requirements
- **Infrastructure**: Consider hardware, networking, and platform components
- **Technology**: Choose appropriate technologies and frameworks
- **Evolution**: Plan for future growth and changes

**Exercise**: Take a familiar application and decompose it using RITE. For each component, document requirements, infrastructure needs, technology choices, and evolution plans.

### Trade-off Analysis

**1. The CAP Theorem in Practice**
- Document consistency, availability, and partition tolerance requirements
- Create a table of trade-offs for each system component
- Justify which aspects can be compromised for each component

**Exercise**: Pick three different types of applications (e.g., banking, social media, gaming) and document which CAP trade-offs you would make for each, and why.

**2. The SPEED Framework**
- **Scalability**: How will the system scale?
- **Performance**: What are the latency requirements?
- **Efficiency**: How cost-effective is the solution?
- **Extensibility**: How easily can it evolve?
- **Durability**: How resilient is the data and service?

**Exercise**: Evaluate a system design using the SPEED framework, scoring each aspect from 1-10 and justifying your ratings.

### Systematic Evaluation Process

**1. Four-Tier Evaluation**
- **Correctness**: Does it solve the core problem?
- **Performance**: Does it meet performance requirements?
- **Complexity**: Is it unnecessarily complicated?
- **Maintainability**: How easily can it be maintained and extended?

**Exercise**: Take an existing system design and evaluate it using the four-tier process, documenting strengths and weaknesses.

### Documentation of Assumptions

**1. The ACES Method**
- **Assumptions**: What you're assuming about the system
- **Constraints**: Limitations you're working within
- **Expectations**: Performance and reliability expectations
- **Scope**: Boundaries of your design

**Exercise**: For a given system design problem, document at least 3 items in each ACES category before starting your design.

### Communication Strategies

**1. The 3-Layer Communication**
- **High-level overview**: 2-minute explanation for executives
- **Component breakdown**: 10-minute explanation for engineering managers
- **Technical deep-dive**: Detailed explanation for fellow engineers

**Exercise**: Practice explaining the same system design at all three layers, timing yourself accordingly.

### Approaching Ambiguous Problems

**1. The QUEST Method**
- **Question**: Ask clarifying questions
- **Understand**: Grasp the core problems
- **Estimate**: Calculate rough numbers
- **Structure**: Create a structured approach
- **Trade-offs**: Analyze and explain trade-offs

**Exercise**: Given an ambiguous problem like "Design YouTube," apply the QUEST method to structure your approach.

### Architect Decision Records (ADRs)

**1. ADR Template**
```
# Title: [Brief description of the decision]

## Status
[Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult because of this change?]

## Alternatives Considered
[What other options were considered and why were they rejected?]
```

**Exercise**: For a recent technical decision you've made, document it using the ADR template.

### Practical Exercises

1. **Component Diagram Challenge**: Draw component diagrams for 5 popular applications (Netflix, Instagram, Uber, etc.)

2. **Traffic Estimation**: Calculate QPS, storage, and bandwidth requirements for a social media platform with 1M DAU

3. **Database Selection Matrix**: Create a comparison matrix for different database types across various use cases

4. **API Design Workshop**: Design RESTful and GraphQL APIs for a food delivery application

5. **Bottleneck Identification**: Identify potential bottlenecks in a given system and propose solutions

6. **Failure Mode Analysis**: Document how a system could fail and design for fault tolerance

7. **Scale Transition Planning**: Create a plan for transitioning a system from 100 to 1M users

8. **Architecture Review**: Conduct a mock architecture review of an open-source project

9. **Technology Selection Exercise**: Given specific requirements, justify technology choices with pros and cons

10. **Backward Compatibility Design**: Design an API change that maintains backward compatibility

Remember, the most important skill for a system architect is the ability to reason about complex systems and make justified trade-offs. Practice these exercises regularly, and always be able to explain the "why" behind every design decision.
