## ‚ö° Final Tips

### Before Interviews
1. **Practice coding without IDE** - Use whiteboard or paper
2. **Time yourself** - Most problems should be solved in 20-30 minutes
3. **Explain your approach** - Practice verbalizing your thought process
4. **Test your code** - Always walk through examples

### During Interviews
1. **Ask clarifying questions** - Understand the problem fully
2. **Start with brute force** - Then optimize
3. **Think out loud** - Share your reasoning
4. **Test edge cases** - Empty inputs, single elements, etc.

### Key Patterns to Master
- **Two Pointers**: For array problems with sorted data
- **Sliding Window**: For substring/subarray problems
- **BFS/DFS**: For tree and graph traversal
- **Dynamic Programming**: For optimization problems
- **Binary Search**: For sorted array search problems
