## Deep Dive #1: Parking Lot System

### 1. Problem Clarification
Design a parking lot management component handling multiple levels, various spot sizes (motorcycle, compact, large, EV), entry/exit flow, ticketing, pricing, and capacity queries.

Assumptions / Scope:
- Supports vehicles: Motorcycle, Car, Bus, EV Car.
- Spot types: Motorcycle, Compact, Large, EV (EV adds charger resource).
- Allocation: First-fit within allowed spot type hierarchy (e.g., Car can use Compact or Large; Motorcycle can use Motorcycle or higher; Bus needs contiguous Large spots or designated Large-Bus spots—choose designated to simplify).
- Pricing: Base rate + hourly tier (e.g., first hour fixed, subsequent per-hour); EV surcharge.
- Time quantization: Round up to nearest 15 minutes.
- Concurrency: Multiple entry/exit kiosks.
- Scale: Single facility (≤ 10k spots) in-memory model with repository abstraction for future persistence.
- Out of scope: Online reservations, dynamic surge pricing, payment integration details.

Non-Functional Goals:
- O(1) or O(log n) spot allocation.
- Thread-safe concurrent entry/exit.
- Extensible pricing & spot selection strategies.
- Auditable transactions (tickets immutable once closed).

### 2. Core Requirements
Functional:
- Issue ticket at entry with assigned spot.
- Release spot & compute fee at exit.
- Query availability (global & per spot type / floor).
- Support EV charging spot allocation constraints.
- Support pricing strategy variants.

Non-Functional:
- Performance: Entry allocation < 10ms typical.
- Consistency: No double-allocation under concurrency.
- Reliability: Recoverable state via repository (pluggable).
- Extensibility: New vehicle & pricing strategies with minimal change.
- Observability: Events for ticket issued/closed.

### 3. Domain Model
Entity / Responsibility:
- ParkingLot: Aggregate root; manages Levels & strategy injection.
- Level: Manages collection of Spots & availability indexes.
- ParkingSpot: Represents individual spot; holds type, state.
- Vehicle (abstract) + subclasses (Motorcycle, Car, Bus, EVCar): Vehicle metadata.
- Ticket: Immutable record (issuedTime, spot, vehicle, rates). Closes with endTime & charge.
- PricingStrategy (interface): Compute fee from ticket time window + vehicle + spot.
- SpotAllocationStrategy (interface): Select suitable spot given vehicle + constraints.
- AvailabilityIndex: Fast lookup structure (per type free spots).
- EventPublisher (interface): Publish domain events.
- Repository interfaces: TicketRepository, SpotRepository (future persistence boundary).
- Clock (interface): Time abstraction for testability.

### 4. Chosen Patterns
Concern | Pattern | Justification
- Spot selection | Strategy | Swap allocation heuristics (nearest, random, balanced).
- Pricing variability | Strategy | Different billing schemes (flat, tiered, EV surcharge).
- Entity creation (Vehicle) | Factory Method | Clean instantiation by type code.
- Events emission | Observer | Subscribers for audit/log.
- Aggregation boundary | Aggregate Root (DDD) | Consistent spot assignment under lot.
- Repository boundary | Repository | Persistence abstraction.
- Immutability of issued data | Value Object (Ticket snapshot fields) | Prevent accidental mutation.
- Time abstraction | Adapter | Clock interface for tests.
- Simplified API for clients | Facade (ParkingLotService) | Hide internal complexity.

### 6. Sequence Diagram (Issue Ticket)
```
Client -> ParkingLotService: issueTicket(vehicle)
ParkingLotService -> AllocationStrategy: findSpot(vehicle)
AllocationStrategy -> Level: requestFreeSpot(vehicleType)
Level -> AvailabilityIndex: popSpotId(typeHierarchy)
AvailabilityIndex --> Level: spotId
Level --> AllocationStrategy: spot
AllocationStrategy --> ParkingLotService: spot

PricingStrategy --> ParkingLotService: baseData
ParkingLotService -> TicketRepository: save(ticket)
ParkingLotService -> EventPublisher: publish(TicketIssued)
ParkingLotService --> Client: Ticket
```

### 7. Class & Interface Sketch (Java-esque Pseudocode)
```java
interface SpotAllocationStrategy { Optional<ParkingSpot> allocate(Vehicle v, List<Level> levels); }
interface PricingStrategy { Money calculate(Ticket ticket, Duration dur); }
interface EventPublisher { void publish(DomainEvent e); }
interface Clock { Instant now(); }

class ParkingLotService {
  private final List<Level> levels;
  private final SpotAllocationStrategy alloc;
  private final PricingStrategy pricing;
  private final TicketRepository tickets;
  private final EventPublisher events;
  private final Clock clock;

  public Ticket issueTicket(Vehicle v) {
    ParkingSpot spot = alloc.allocate(v, levels)
      .orElseThrow(() -> new NoSpotAvailableException());
    spot.occupy(v.getId());
    Ticket t = Ticket.open(UUID.randomUUID(), v, spot.getId(), clock.now());
    tickets.save(t);
    events.publish(new TicketIssuedEvent(t));
    return t;
  }

  public Ticket closeTicket(UUID ticketId) {
    Ticket t = tickets.get(ticketId);
    if (t.isClosed()) return t; // idempotent
    Instant end = clock.now();
    Duration dur = Duration.between(t.getStartTime(), end);
    Money fee = pricing.calculate(t, dur);
    t = t.close(end, fee); // returns new immutable instance
    tickets.update(t);
    Level level = findLevelBySpot(t.getSpotId());
    level.releaseSpot(t.getSpotId());
    events.publish(new TicketClosedEvent(t));
    return t;
  }
}

class Level {
  private final Map<String, ParkingSpot> spots; // id->spot
  private final AvailabilityIndex index;
  synchronized Optional<ParkingSpot> acquire(SpotTypeNeeded need) {
    String spotId = index.nextFree(need);
    if (spotId == null) return Optional.empty();
    ParkingSpot s = spots.get(spotId);
    s.markReserved();
    return Optional.of(s);
  }
  synchronized void releaseSpot(String spotId) { spots.get(spotId).free(); index.push(spotId); }
}

final class Ticket { /* immutable close() returns new instance */ }
```

### 8. Concurrency & Thread Safety Notes
- Level.acquire/release synchronized to serialize spot state changes per level (reduces contention vs global lock).
- AllocationStrategy may iterate levels; acquires one spot then stops to avoid holding multiple locks.
- Ticket operations idempotent: closeTicket returns existing closed ticket to tolerate retries.
- Potential optimization: Lock striping on spot buckets if contention high.
- Read availability queries can use atomic snapshot (copy of counters) for lock-free reads.

### 9. Error Handling & Validation
- NoSpotAvailableException for allocation failures.
- Validation: Vehicle type supported, spot type compatibility enforced in strategy.
- Defensive: Null checks, duration non-negative.
- Repository exceptions wrapped into domain-level ParkingLotException.
- Events publishing failure: log & continue (non-critical) or configurable policy.

### 10. Extension & Variation Points
- PricingStrategy: Add weekend, progressive, surge pricing.
- AllocationStrategy: Nearest-exit, load-balancing, EV-priority.
- Spot types: Add HandicappedSpot with a policy decorator.
- Persistence: Implement repositories (SQL, NoSQL) behind interfaces.
- Observability: Add MetricsDecorator around service.

### 11. Complexity & Performance
Operation | Complexity | Notes
- Allocate spot | O(k) where k levels until first free (expected small). Index pop O(1).
- Release spot | O(1)
- Availability query (aggregate) | O(L) or cached O(1) with periodic recompute.
- Close ticket | O(1)
Space: O(N) spots + O(T) active tickets.

### 12. Testing Strategy
Unit:
- AllocationStrategy: compatibility & fallback.
- PricingStrategy: boundary rounding 59m vs 61m.
- Level concurrency: acquire/release correctness.
Integration:
- Issue+close happy path with in-memory repos.
- EV spot scarcity scenario fallback to non-EV disallowed.
Edge Cases:
- Lot full.
- Vehicle tries to close nonexistent ticket.
- Re-close ticket idempotency.
Property Tests:
- Allocation then release count invariant (free+occupied == total).
- Monotonic fee increase with time.
Mutation Tests:
- Alter rounding logic should break tests.

### 13. Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns Avoided
- No God Object: Pricing & allocation separated.
- Avoid Singleton for strategies: injected dependencies.
- Avoid tight coupling: Repositories & strategies via interfaces.
- Law of Demeter: Service interacts through defined interfaces.
- Immutability: Ticket state transitions via new instance.

### 14. Possible Enhancements / Next Iteration
- Reservation API with hold expiration (optimistic tokens).
- Dynamic pricing engine with rule evaluation.
- Multi-lot federation service.
- Event sourcing for audit trail.
- Asynchronous spot sensor updates integration.

### 15. Interview Evaluation Rubric (Parking Lot)
- Correct domain boundaries (Lot, Level, Spot, Ticket, Strategies).
- Thread safety reasoning & chosen locking granularity.
- Strategy pattern usage justified (pricing/allocation variability).
- Idempotent operations & error handling clarity.
- Extensibility articulation (new spot types / pricing) with minimal change.
- Performance tradeoffs (O(1) allocations, snapshot availability plan).
- Testing seams identified (strategies, service orchestrations).
- Avoiding over-engineering while enabling future scaling.

## Deep Dive #2: Elevator Control System

### 1. Problem Clarification
Manage multiple elevators servicing requests (hall calls up/down + car floor selections) optimizing wait & travel time.
Assumptions: Up to 16 elevators, 100 floors, mixed peak traffic patterns.

### 2. Core Requirements
Functional: Register hall call; assign elevator; handle car button; move, open/close doors; maintenance mode.
Non-Functional: Fairness, minimize average wait (<30s target), concurrency safe, extensible dispatch algorithms.

### 3. Domain Model
- ElevatorController (aggregate orchestrator)
- ElevatorCar: state (currentFloor, direction, doorState, stops queue)
- DispatchStrategy: assign call to car
- HallCall: (floor, direction)
- CarRequest: (carId, floor)
- Scheduler (tick) / Clock
- EventPublisher

### 4. Chosen Patterns
Strategy (dispatch), Command (requests), Observer (events), State (door/movement), Template Method (tick loop variant), Facade (service API).

### 5. UML (ASCII)
```
Controller -> Strategy
Controller -> * ElevatorCar
ElevatorCar has State (DoorState, Direction)
```

### 6. Sequence (Hall Call)
User->Controller: hallCall(floor, dir)
Controller->Strategy: selectCar(call)
Strategy->Controller: carId
Controller->ElevatorCar: enqueueStop(floor)

### 7. Sketch
```java
interface DispatchStrategy { ElevatorCar select(List<ElevatorCar> cars, HallCall call); }
class ElevatorController { /* holds cars, strategy; tick updates movement */ }
```

### 8. Concurrency
Per-car lock for queue mutations. Controller uses read lock for status snapshots, write for assignment.

### 9. Errors
Invalid floor; Car offline -> fallback selection.

### 10. Extension Points
Add destination control panels; PeakTrafficStrategy swapping at runtime.

### 11. Complexity
Dispatch O(E); Movement O(1) per tick; Space O(E + pendingCalls).

### 12. Testing
Strategy fairness; Edge floors; Simulate traffic bursts.

### 13. Pitfalls Avoided
No global giant lock; Strategy pluggable; Clear state separation.

### 14. Enhancements
Predictive pre-positioning; Energy optimization.

### 15. Rubric
Correct modeling, strategy justification, concurrency plan, scheduling tradeoffs.

---
## Deep Dive #3: Library Management System

### 1. Problem Clarification
Track catalog items, copies, members, loans, holds, fines.
Assumptions: Physical library; moderate scale (≤100k items).

### 2. Core Requirements
Functional: Search catalog; checkout/return; place hold; accrue fines; pay fine.
Non-Functional: Consistent loan state; extensible media types; search latency acceptable (in-memory index prototype).

### 3. Domain Model
- LibraryService (facade)
- Catalog (BookItem aggregates)
- BookItem (copy with barcode)
- Member (with account status)
- Loan (value object immutable after close)
- HoldRequest
- FineCalculator (strategy)
- Repository interfaces

### 4. Patterns
Strategy (fine calc), Repository, Factory (create media item), Observer (events), Specification (search filters), Facade.

### 5. UML (ASCII)
```
LibraryService -> Catalog -> * BookItem
LibraryService -> LoanRepository
Member -> * Loan
```

### 6. Sequence (Checkout)
Client->Service: checkout(barcode, member)
Service->Catalog: fetchItem
Service: validate availability
Service->LoanRepo: save(new Loan)
Service->EventPublisher: LoanCreated

### 7. Sketch
```java
interface FineStrategy { Money compute(Loan loan, Instant returnTime); }
class LibraryService { checkout(); returnItem(); placeHold(); }
```

### 8. Concurrency
Atomic compare-and-set on item status; per-item lock or optimistic version.

### 9. Errors
Item not found; Already loaned; Hold conflict; Fine payment failure.

### 10. Extensions
E-books provider integration; Recommendation engine; Overdue notifications.

### 11. Complexity
Checkout O(1); Search O(log n) via index; Holds list per title O(h).

### 12. Testing
Loan lifecycle; Fine calculation rounding; Hold prioritization.

### 13. Pitfalls Avoided
Mixing catalog data with loan state; Overusing inheritance (use composition for media differences).

### 14. Enhancements
Full-text search; Sharded catalog repository; Event sourcing of circulations.

### 15. Rubric
Entity vs value clarity; Consistency strategy; Extensible fines & media types.

=== STYLE RULES ===
- Prefer interfaces over concrete types at boundaries.
- Keep methods cohesive; single reason to change.
- Avoid premature patterns (justify usage).
- Name consistently (nouns for entities, verbs for commands).
- Show at most 10–15 classes per diagram (aggregate if needed).
- Provide balanced brevity—no boilerplate (… for trivial getters).

=== SUBTASK REQUEST TYPES SUPPORTED ===
If I ask: 
- "Refactor for DIP": show inversion points.
- "Add persistence": show Repository abstraction & mapping.
- "Optimize concurrency": propose lock striping / immutable snapshots.
- "Add caching layer": show Decorator around repository/service.
- "Add test plan": focus only test matrix.

When uncertain: ask clarifying questions first.

Begin now. First, list the categorized 100 LLD problems with 1‑line description each, then proceed to first problem in full template unless I say 'catalog only'.
```

### Quick Usage Example
Copy prompt → ask: “Generate catalog only” or “Start with ‘Parking Lot System’ full design.”

### Evaluation Rubric (Interviewer Focus)
| Dimension | Signals |
|-----------|---------|
| Requirements clarity | Early explicit assumptions |
| OO modeling | Proper boundaries, cohesive classes |
| Pattern fit | Patterns solve real forces, not ornamental |
| SOLID adherence | Minimal god classes, interfaces segregated |
| Extensibility | Clear variation points (Strategy, Factory) |
| Concurrency safety | Identifies mutable shared state & mitigation |
| Complexity reasoning | Big‑O for critical paths |
| Testing approach | Identifiable seams & isolation |
| Tradeoffs | Explicit alternatives & rationale |
| Communication | Structured, layered explanation |
