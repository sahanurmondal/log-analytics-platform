The system needs to support different types of SMS with varying priorities, such as one time passwords (OTPs) for login/payment and delivery notifications for orders.\nThe requirements are as follows:\nMessage Types and Prioritization\nOTP SMS should be considered high priority and must reach the user within seconds.\nDelivery updates (such as \u201cYour order will arrive today\u201d) are medium priority and can tolerate slight delays.\nSystem should not allow low priority messages to block high priority ones.\nMessage Scheduling\nThe system should handle millions of SMS per day.\nOTP SMS must be sent immediately, bypassing queues if needed.\nDelivery notifications should be scheduled efficiently, with mechanisms to avoid spamming users.\nScalability and Reliability\nThe system should scale to handle 1 billion users globally with peaks during sales or festival seasons.\nIt should be resilient to SMS gateway failures and reroute traffic automatically if one provider is down.\nOptimization Requirements\nDevising an algorithm to schedule OTPs and delivery notifications together without delaying OTPs.\nEnsure that high priority OTPs preempt delivery messages without starving delivery messages entirely.\nMessages must be tracked with status (sent, failed, retrying).\nExample Scenarios\nA user tries to log in and requests an OTP at the same time when delivery notifications for thousands of users are being sent. The OTP should be delivered immediately without being delayed by the delivery messages.\nIf a delivery message fails due to SMS provider downtime, the system should retry or route through a backup provider, but this must not interfere with OTP traffic.\nDuring peak sale hours (e.g., festive season), millions of delivery messages are being sent, yet OTP delivery time should remain within seconds.", "company": "Media.net", "tags": ["High-Level Design (HLD)", "System Design", "Message Queue", "Kafka", "Prioritization", "Notification System", "High Scalability", "Distributed System"], "category": "DSA", "difficulty": "Medium", "scraped_at": "2025-09-15T10:48:18.493085", "thread_id": "worker-4570176112", "processing_version": "2.1", "source": "enginebogie.com", "processed_at": "2025-09-15T11:07:33.527192"}, {"url": "https://enginebogie.com/public/question/design-cdn/69", "title": "69.

You are given an array of integers representing the locations of existing dockyards on a one-dimensional line.\nYour goal is to find the optimal positions to build exactly two new dockyards. A placement is considered optimal if it minimizes the maximum distance from any point on the coastline to its nearest dockyard. Essentially, you want to reduce the largest gap between any two consecutive dockyards as much as possible.\nReturn the locations for the two new dockyards. The order of the returned locations does not matter.\nInput Format:\nAn array of integers representing the locations of existing dockyards.\nOutput Format:\nAn array containing two numbers, representing the locations for the two new dockyards.

The largest gap is between 4 and 10, with a length of 6. To minimize the maximum distance, we should place the two new dockyards within this gap to divide it into three equal smaller segments. The new locations would be at 4 + (6/3) = 6.0 and 4 + 2*(6/3) = 8.0.

The gaps are between (10, 20) with length 10, and (20, 50) with length 30. The largest gap is 30. By placing two new dockyards at 30 and 40, we divide the largest gap into three equal parts.

For the question purpose, we deal with only the SERVER_INSTANCE type of resources. Each resource will have some pricing and CPU configuration.\nData Center: Data center is location-based storage of resources. All the resources of the same data center reside in a single geographical location.\nTask: Each task will be executed on a single/multiple SERVER_INSTANCE type of resource. Systems can be asked to execute the task on one (single instance)/multiple resources (multiple instances) simultaneously. Resources can be demanded based on high or low cpu intensive use cases. Whenever a task is submitted the minimum cpu configuration requirement needs to be passed. A resource can execute a single task at a time. As soon as the task is complete, resources become available for further tasks.\nRequirements P0\nAll the below requirements are for a given data center.\nProvide an interface to add/delete different types of resources to the data center.\nProvide an interface to see all the available resources based on the resource type and resource type-specific configuration filter.\ne.g. SERVER_INSTANCE, 8 (CPU)\nReturn a list of resources available having at least these configurations.\nProvide an interface to see all the allocated resources based on the resource type. e.g. SERVER_INSTANCE\nFor a given task, allocate a single resource and execute the task on the resource.\nResource allocation can be done through different criteria.\nCriteria 1: allocate the resources having the least price.\nCriteria 2: allocate the resources having the best execution time.\nFor simplicity, the execution time can be considered inversely proportional to (CPU) Satisfying minimum configuration requirements is important apart from these criteria.\nAn interface to check the status of the task, resources allocated, and start and end time.\nHandle error scenarios appropriately.\nPlease remember: You are expected to write the system which mirrors production quality code, rather than just implementing these functions.\nRequirements P1\nHandle concurrency cases for different scenarios.\nIf the resource is not available, Put the task in the waiting queue and wait for the resources to be available. Assign the task in a FIFO manner based on their matching configuration to the free resource. You can choose to do a non-blocking task submission in this case.\nMake your code generic to handle the allocation of more than one resource based on the given criteria for future use cases.\nThings to keep in mind\nYou are only allowed to use in-memory data structures.\nYou are NOT allowed to use any databases.\nYou are NOT required to have a full-fledged web service or APIs exposed.\nA working code is NECESSARY. Evaluation will not be done if your code is not running. So ensure you time yourselves accordingly.\nYou are required to showcase the work of the above concept.\nJust a main class that simulates the above operations is enough.\nShould you have any doubts, you are allowed to make appropriate assumptions, as long as you can explain them during the evaluation.\nYou can code on your favorite IDEs as long as you paste the code back into the tool within the allotted time frame.\nHow you will be evaluated\nYou are expected to write production-quality code while implementing the requirements.

Along the circular route, there are n gas stations, and the amount of gas at the ith station is given by the array gas. Additionally, it costs cost[i] units of gas to travel from the ith station to its next station (i + 1) in the clockwise direction.\nYou must start your journey at one of the gas stations and travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction. Your goal is to determine the starting gas station's index, such that you can complete the trip without running out of gas.\nWrite a function findStartingGasStation to find the starting gas station's index. If a valid starting station exists, return its index; otherwise, return -1. If there is a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.\nThe function should take two integer arrays as input:\ngas: An array representing the amount of gas at each station (positive integers).\ncost: An array representing the cost of travel between stations (positive integers).\nExample 1:\nInput: \ngas [ ] = [1,2,3,4,5], \ncost[ ] = [3,4,5,1,2]\n\nOutput:  3\n\nExplanation:\n- Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 units of gas. \n- Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\n- Travel to station 4.

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can only take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available and they cannot start eating before getting both forks.\nEating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed. The problem is how to design a discipline of behavior (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.\nFunctional Requirements\nPhilosopher Actions: Each philosopher can perform one of three actions: think, try to pick up forks (both left and right), or eat. Philosophers must be able to pick up the forks and eat only when both their left and right forks are available.\nAvoid Deadlocks: Ensure that your solution prevents deadlock, where no philosopher can eat because each has picked up one fork and is waiting for the other.\nAvoid Starvation: Ensure that every philosopher eventually gets to eat. A solution where a philosopher could end up never eating (because of being continuously preempted by others) is not acceptable.\nConcurrency: Implement the solution in a multithreaded fashion, with each philosopher represented by a separate thread or process.\nTechnical Requirements\nLanguage: You can choose any programming language that supports multithreading and synchronization mechanisms (e.g., Java, C++, Python with threading).\nSynchronization Mechanisms: Utilize appropriate synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes, semaphores, or monitors to manage the access to forks.\nLogging: Implement logging to show the state of each philosopher (thinking, waiting for forks, eating) and the state of each fork (available, held by philosopher X).", "company": "Unknown Company", "tags": ["Concurrency", "Multithreading", "Thread Synchronization", "Thread Safety", "Deadlock"], "category": "DSA", "difficulty": "Hard", "scraped_at": "2025-09-15T09:16:21.702186", "thread_id": "worker-4489912128", "question_number": 690, "source": "enginebogie.com", "processed_at": "2025-09-15T11:07:33.523923", "processing_version": "2.1"}, {"url": "https://enginebogie.com/public/question/implement-in-memory-multi-threaded-queue-like-sqs/691", "title": "691.

Therefore, the first and third sprinklers together can cover the entire garden, needing a minimum of 2 sprinklers.\nExample 3:\nInput: p = [0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Since all sprinklers have a power of 0, they can only water their own position.

Each algorithm should adhere to a common interface, allowing for interchangeability and flexibility in sorting strategy.\nLogging Mechanism: Develop a logging mechanism that can log messages with varying levels of importance (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and to multiple outputs (e.g., console, file). The logging format should be standardized and include timestamps.\nSorting Logger: Integrate the logging mechanism with the sorting algorithms to log key events during the sorting process, such as initialization, comparisons, swaps, and completion. The logs should provide insights into the algorithm's behavior and performance.\nTechnical Requirements:\nLanguage and Frameworks: You are free to choose an object-oriented programming language like Java, Python, or C#. If using Java, consider interfaces and abstract classes; if Python, duck typing and abstract base classes can be utilized.\nSOLID Principles: Ensure your design strictly follows SOLID principles for OOP design.\nDesign Patterns: Apply appropriate design patterns, such as Strategy for sorting algorithms and Factory or Singleton for the logging mechanism.\nError Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage invalid inputs, unsupported operations, or failures during sorting or logging.\nExample Usage:\nA user selects the Quick Sort algorithm and starts the sorting process on an array of integers.

To handle such cases efficiently, a resolution system is needed, where customers can log their unsuccessful transactions and raise complaints against them. The system must categorize customer issues into several types, such as payment-related, mutual fund-related, gold-related, or insurance-related. Different customer service agents will have their specific expertise based on the issue type, whom the system will assign the issues by marking them waiting in case all agents are busy. The customer service agents can work on one issue at a time and update its status, and once it is resolved, the agent will receive another issue.\nThe solution should incorporate the following features:\nCustomers can log a complaint against any unsuccessful transaction.\nCustomer Service Agents can search for customer issues with issue ID or customer details (email).\nAgents can view their assigned issues and mark them resolved once they are resolved.\nSystem should assign the issue to agents based on an assigning strategy.\nSystem should allow the admin to onboard new agents.\nSystem should allow the admin to view the agent's work history.\nImplementation requirements\nYour solution should implement the following functions.

This will be a rule-based journey framework where a user will onboard a journey and move along various stages on the basis of specific conditions.\nRequirements:\nJourney:\njourney is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents a predefined path to track a user on.\nA journey consists of 'n' stages, and users must complete specific actions/events to advance to the next stage.\nMultiple users can onboard to the same journey.\nA user can onboard a journey only once.\nThere will be complete isolation across different journeys i.e. anything in one journey won\u2019t depend on any other journey.\nourneys can be of 2 types, time-bound (having a start-date, end-date) and perpetual (no validity and will remain live till it\u2019s active).\nFirst stage in the journey will be the onboarding stage, middle stages will be the onward stages and the final stage will be the terminal stage. We will have to mark the journey as active for it to be picked as part of the evaluation. By default on journey creation, it should be inactive. Also when the validity period of a journey is over, mark it inactive for time-bound journeys. Example:\nThere are 2 Journeys: J1 : Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3. Onboarding step for Stage 1 is login. For stage 2 is user opening recharge page and Stage 3 is user doing a recharge transaction\nJ2: Stage 1 -> Stage 2. Onboarding step is the user opening an upi lite account. For stage 2 is the user doing a top up on their upi lite account.\nLet's say there are 3 users: User 1: Logins to the app, hence is on stage 1 of J1. User opens the recharge page, at this time the user moves to stage 2 of J1. User 2: Logins to the app, hence is on stage 1 of J1. User opens the recharge page, at this time the user moves to stage 2 of J1 and then does a recharge transaction and is finally moved to stage 3 of J1 User 3: Logins to the app, hence is on stage 1 of J1. User opens up an upi account and is onboarded to J2.\nSo at this point of time, User 1 is at stage 2 of J1, User 2 is at stage 3 of J1 and User 3 is at stage 1 of J1 and stage 1 of J2.\nMandatory Implementations:\ncreateJourney(Journey journey) This will help in creating a journey in the system.\nupdateState(String JourneyId, boolean active) Mark journey as active/inactive.\ngetJourney(String journeyId) To get the journey details\nevaluate(String userId, Payload payload) Input payload can contain some fixed params and a Map of <key, value> Basis the payload, 3 things may happen:\nThe payload may match the condition for onboarding the user to a journey. In this case, the user will get onboarded to the journey. The payload may match the condition required for moving to the next stage for a user already onboarded on a specific stage. In this case, the user will move to the next stage in that journey. The payload will not match any condition, in this case it will be simply ignored. Users onboarding/transitions in a journey will happen only when the journey is ACTIVE.\ngetCurrentStage(String userId, String journeyId) Find the current stage of a user in the given journey id.\nisOnboarded(String userId, String journeyId) Return true/false basis on the condition that whether the user is part of the journey or not.\nOptional 1: Provide a way where we can send SMS to a user as soon as any stage transition happens for that user (onboarding to the journey or moving from one stage to another). It should have the capability to decide for which stage we want to provide this feature.\nOptional 2: Add support for recurring journeys, where a single user can onboard the journey multiple times.\nWhy the journey service?\nThis service serves as a platform for creating multiple journeys for different user paths and tracking users along the journey, taking business decisions accordingly in real time without the need of heavy database queries. Additionally, the service can trigger actions when users transition between stages or remain stationary at a particular stage for an extended period. For example, it can send notifications to users who have viewed a product but haven't made a purchase.\nSystem Architecture:\nImagine all the events of the entire product systems flowing to some message queue, and the journey service acting as one of the consumers of the messages. All the messages flowing in are being evaluated (as per the evaluate(String userId, Payload payload)) and this service keeping track of the user and journey status for real time use case by different product systems using getCurrentStage(String userId, String journeyId)\nPoints to note:\nYour code should cover all the mandatory functionalities explained above. Your code should be executable and clean. All necessary validations must be present. In case of an exception, proper errorCode must be present.

The system is expected to give this count, as fast as possible\nProblem Statement:\nYou need to design a system that is able to track pending entities.\nAn entity is identified using a unique ID and a list of hierarchical tags.\nThere are 3 parts to this problem statement. startTracking, endTracking and getCounts.\nWhen an entity is being tracked, you will be provided with an identifier for the entity, and a hierarchical tags associated with the entity to be tracked.\nWhen counts are being retrieved, you will be provided with a partial list of tags, for which the accumulated counts need to be returned. This partial list of tags will follow the same hierarchy order as given in the input. (Should become clear with the example shown below).\nThe following is a guide for the interfaces you may have in your system.\nAn interface to start tracking the counts for the entity.

A light is either green (both directions on that road may cross) or red (both directions must wait). At no time may both roads be green simultaneously.\nInitially, Road A is green and Road B is red.\nWhen a road is green, any number of cars on that road (in either direction) may cross, but no car from the other road may cross until the light flips.\nFlipping the light switches which road is green; you must not call the flip operation if the current road is already green.\nMultiple cars arrive over time, possibly concurrently, and your solution must be deadlock-free (no cars remain blocked forever if progress is possible).\nNo two cars from different roads may be in the intersection at the same time.\nYou are given a function to implement that will be invoked by each car\u2019s thread upon arrival:\nvoid carArrived(\n    int carId,                 // unique id of the arriving car\n    int roadId,                // 1 = Road A, 2 = Road B\n    int direction,             // 1=N\u2192S, 2=S\u2192N, 3=W\u2192E, 4=E\u2192W\n    function<void()> turnGreen,// call this to turn the light green for roadId (only if currently red)\n    function<void()> crossCar  // call this when the car actually crosses\n)\nRequirements:\nEnsure mutual exclusion between roads: while one road is crossing, the other must not enter.\nEnsure no deadlocks: cars must eventually cross according to the rules.\nDo not call turnGreen() if roadId already has green.\nWhen the light flips to a road, all waiting cars on that road should be allowed to cross (one by one calling crossCar()), until a flip is required again.\nYou may use any standard concurrency primitives (mutexes, condition variables, semaphores, monitors, etc.).\nDo not introduce extra output; the only side effects should be legitimate calls to turnGreen() and crossCar() following the constraints.\nExample 1:\nInput (arrival events in time order):\nt=1: carId=101, roadId=1, direction=1\nt=2: carId=102, roadId=1, direction=2\nt=3: carId=201, roadId=2, direction=3\n\nPossible Output (sequence of operations):\ncrossCar(101)\ncrossCar(102)\nturnGreen()           // flip to Road B\ncrossCar(201)\n\nExplanation\nRoad A starts green, so cars 101 and 102 (both on Road A) may cross without flipping. When car 201 arrives on Road B, it must wait until Road A finishes, then the controller flips using turnGreen() and allows 201 to cross.\nExample 2:\nInput:\nt=1: carId=301, roadId=2, direction=4\nt=2: carId=103, roadId=1, direction=1\nt=3: carId=302, roadId=2, direction=3\nt=4: carId=104, roadId=1, direction=2\n\nPossible Output:\ncrossCar(103)         // Road A is initially green\ncrossCar(104)\nturnGreen()           // flip to Road B once A is idle\ncrossCar(301)\ncrossCar(302)\n\nExplanation\nEven though a Road B car (301) arrives first, the light is initially green for Road A. The controller lets A\u2019s cars go first without flipping prematurely, then flips once A becomes idle, and processes waiting Road B cars. At no point is turnGreen() called when its road is already green.\nConstraints:\nUp to 10^4 arriving cars; arrival order is non-decreasing in time but may be concurrent.\nturnGreen() must be called only when flipping from the other road to roadId.\ncrossCar() must be called with mutual exclusion across roads; cars on the same road may cross one at a time (no overlapping calls), but never overlap with cars from the other road.\nYour implementation must be deadlock-free and race-condition safe.\nNo fairness guarantee is mandated beyond deadlock freedom, but starving one road indefinitely is considered poor behavior in interviews; design for reasonable alternation when both sides have demand.", "company": "Google", "tags": ["Multi-Threaded Services", "Concurrency", "Synchronized", "Locking", "Deadlock Prevention", "Thread Safety", "Multithreading"], "category": "JAVA", "difficulty": "Medium", "scraped_at": "2025-09-15T01:44:19.010136", "thread_id": "worker-4324410704", "processed_at": "2025-09-15T11:07:33.435608", "processing_version": "2.1", "question_number": 1831, "source": "enginebogie.com"}, {"url": "https://enginebogie.com/public/question/multithreaded-fizzbuzz/1832", "title": "1832.

Two people, A and B, start from two different cities and both need to get to the same destination city. They are allowed to travel independently or to meet at some intermediate city and then continue together toward the destination (if they travel together on a shared road segment they pay that road cost only once for that shared portion). All road costs are non-negative.\nCompute the minimum total cost required for both people to reach the destination city under these rules.\n(Equivalently, choose a meeting city X (which may be one of their start cities or the destination). A travels from A_start to X, B travels from B_start to X, then from X they both travel to dest - the shared final portion X \u2192 dest is paid once.

Each version is described by its name, a release order, and an operating system (OS) compatibility range defined by a minOS and maxOS. This range is inclusive. The minOS can be negative infinity, and maxOS can be positive infinity, indicating an open-ended range.\nYour task is to create a function that takes a target OS version as input.

If multiple applications support the OS, the one with the larger release order is considered \"later\". If no application supports the given OS, you should return a null or equivalent value.\nInput Format:\nA list of application details.

Your objective is to transform S such that all 'A' characters form a single, contiguous block within the string. You need to achieve this with the minimum possible total cost.\nThere are two types of operations, each with an associated cost:\nMoving an 'A': The cost of moving an 'A' character to a position currently occupied by a '-' (an empty slot) is x.\nConverting a 'B': The cost of converting a 'B' character into a '-' (an empty slot) is y.\nCrucially, an 'A' character cannot be moved directly into a position currently occupied by a 'B'. If an 'A' needs to occupy a slot where a 'B' currently resides, that 'B' must first be converted into a '-' at cost y. After this conversion, the 'A' can then move into the now-empty slot at an additional cost of x. Therefore, the total cost for an 'A' to occupy a spot that was initially a 'B' is x + y.\nYou will be given Q queries. For each query, you will receive a specific pair of costs, x and y.

The maze is represented by a 2D matrix where each cell can be one of three types:\n#: A wall, which the robot cannot pass through.\n.: An empty cell, which the robot can move into.\nE: An escape point, where the robot successfully exits the maze.\nThe robot is \"blind\" and can move in four directions: Right (R), Up (U), Left (L), Down (D). It does not know its current position or the layout of the maze. Your task is to devise a universal sequence of commands (e.g., \"DRR\", \"RU\") such that no matter which valid empty cell the robot starts from, if it executes this sequence of commands, it will eventually reach an 'E' (escape point) and exit the maze.\nThe robot executes commands one by one. If a command attempts to move the robot into a wall, the robot simply stays in its current cell but the command is still considered executed. The robot can exit the maze early if it reaches an 'E' at any point during the command execution, even if the command sequence is not fully completed.\nYour goal is to find any such sequence of commands. An optimal solution would aim for the shortest possible command sequence.\nInput Format:\nThe input will be a 2D matrix representing the maze.\nThe first line contains two integers R and C, representing the number of rows and columns of the maze.\nThe next R lines each contain a string of C characters, where each character is '#', '.', or 'E'.\nOutput Format:\nA single string representing the universal command sequence.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n4 5\n#####\n#...#\n#..E#\n#####\n\nOutput:\nDRR\n\nExplanation:\nLet's trace from all possible starting points:\n- From (1,1) (top-left '.'):\n  - D: moves to (2,1)\n  - R: moves to (2,2)\n  - R: moves to (2,3) which is 'E'.

The distance is defined as the number of cells traversed (including empty 'E' cells) to reach the first 'X' or map boundary.\nA robot satisfies the query if its actual distance to the closest blocker in each direction is greater than or equal to the corresponding value in the query array.\nYour task is to return the coordinates [row, col] of all robots that satisfy the given query.\nInput Format:\nA 2D character array locationMap (rows x cols).\nA 1D integer array query of length 4, [dist_left, dist_top, dist_bottom, dist_right].\nOutput Format:\nA list of lists (or array of arrays) where each inner list [row, col] represents the coordinates of a robot satisfying the query. The order of coordinates in the output does not matter.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nlocationMap = [\n  ['O', 'E', 'E', 'X'],\n  ['E', 'E', 'O', 'E'],\n  ['X', 'E', 'E', 'E']\n]\nquery = [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nOutput:\n[[0, 0], [1, 2]]\n\nExplanation:\nLet's analyze the robot at (0,0) for query = [1, 1, 1, 1]:\n-   **Left:** Closest blocker is the boundary at column -1. Actual distance = 1. Query `dist_left = 1`. (1 >= 1) is True.\n-   **Top:** Closest blocker is the boundary at row -1. Actual distance = 1. Query `dist_top = 1`. (1 >= 1) is True.\n-   **Bottom:** Cell `(1,0)` is 'E', `(2,0)` is 'X'. Closest blocker is `(2,0)`. Actual distance = 2. Query `dist_bottom = 1`. (2 >= 1) is True.\n-   **Right:** Cell `(0,1)` is 'E', `(0,2)` is 'E', `(0,3)` is 'X'. Closest blocker is `(0,3)`. Actual distance = 3. Query `dist_right = 1`. (3 >= 1) is True.\nSince all conditions are met, `[0,0]` is included in the output.\n\nLet's analyze the robot at (1,2) for query = [1, 1, 1, 1]:\n-   **Left:** Cell `(1,1)` is 'E', `(1,0)` is 'E'. Closest blocker is boundary at column -1. Actual distance = 3. Query `dist_left = 1`. (3 >= 1) is True.\n-   **Top:** Cell `(0,2)` is 'E'. Closest blocker is boundary at row -1. Actual distance = 2. Query `dist_top = 1`. (2 >= 1) is True.\n-   **Bottom:** Cell `(2,2)` is 'E'. Closest blocker is boundary at row 3. Actual distance = 2. Query `dist_bottom = 1`. (2 >= 1) is True.\n-   **Right:** Cell `(1,3)` is 'E'. Closest blocker is boundary at column 4. Actual distance = 2. Query `dist_right = 1`.
