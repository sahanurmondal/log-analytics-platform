    "description": "Given n rectangular buildings in a 2-dimensional city, we have to compute the skyline of these buildings, eliminating hidden lines. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.\nThe geometric information of each building is given in the array of buildings where buildings[i] = [left_i, right_i, height_i]:\nleft_i is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.\nright_i is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.\nheight_i is the height of the ith building.\nYou may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.\nThe skyline should be represented as a list of \"key points\" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.\n**Note: **\nThere must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]\nExample 1:\nInput: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]\nOutput: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]\nExample 2:\nInput: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]\nOutput: [[0,3],[5,0]]\nConstraints:\n1 <= buildings.length <= 104\n0 <= left_i < right_i <= 231 - 1\n1 <= height_i <= 231 - 1\nbuildings is sorted by left_i in non-decreasing order.",

The system needs to support different types of SMS with varying priorities, such as one time passwords (OTPs) for login/payment and delivery notifications for orders.\nThe requirements are as follows:\nMessage Types and Prioritization\nOTP SMS should be considered high priority and must reach the user within seconds.\nDelivery updates (such as “Your order will arrive today”) are medium priority and can tolerate slight delays.\nSystem should not allow low priority messages to block high priority ones.\nMessage Scheduling\nThe system should handle millions of SMS per day.\nOTP SMS must be sent immediately, bypassing queues if needed.\nDelivery notifications should be scheduled efficiently, with mechanisms to avoid spamming users.\nScalability and Reliability\nThe system should scale to handle 1 billion users globally with peaks during sales or festival seasons.\nIt should be resilient to SMS gateway failures and reroute traffic automatically if one provider is down.\nOptimization Requirements\nDevising an algorithm to schedule OTPs and delivery notifications together without delaying OTPs.\nEnsure that high priority OTPs preempt delivery messages without starving delivery messages entirely.\nMessages must be tracked with status (sent, failed, retrying).\nExample Scenarios\nA user tries to log in and requests an OTP at the same time when delivery notifications for thousands of users are being sent. The OTP should be delivered immediately without being delayed by the delivery messages.\nIf a delivery message fails due to SMS provider downtime, the system should retry or route through a backup provider, but this must not interfere with OTP traffic.\nDuring peak sale hours (e.g., festive season), millions of delivery messages are being sent, yet OTP delivery time should remain within seconds.",

The goal is to allow users to subscribe to products and receive them at fixed intervals such as daily, weekly, or monthly. The system should handle large scale usage while ensuring reliability and efficiency.\nThe requirements are as follows:\nUser Subscription Lifecycle\nA user should be able to subscribe to one or multiple products with configurable frequency (daily, weekly, monthly).\nUsers can pause, resume, or cancel their subscriptions anytime.\nUpdates to delivery address, payment method, or subscription frequency must be supported.\nOrder Creation and Scheduling\nThe system should generate recurring orders automatically based on subscription schedules.\nOrders must avoid duplication even under distributed scheduling jobs.\nThe system should handle peak scenarios (for example, millions of daily orders generated at midnight).\nInventory Management\nEach scheduled order must check inventory before confirmation.\nIf inventory is short, the system should handle partial or skipped deliveries gracefully.\nUsers should be notified if their subscription cannot be fulfilled.\nPayment Handling\nEach order should trigger an automatic payment attempt using the user’s stored payment method.\nFailed payments should trigger retries and send notifications to the user.\nThe system should prevent delivery if payment is not successful.\nNotifications\nNotify users about upcoming deliveries, successful payments, delivery status, and payment or inventory failures.\nNotifications should scale to millions of users daily.\nScalability and Reliability\nSystem should handle 1 billion total users and tens of millions of active subscriptions.\nDesign should ensure high availability and fault tolerance for recurring jobs like subscription scheduling.\nExample Scenarios:\nA user subscribes for fresh vegetables every day at 6 AM. The system must generate daily orders, check inventory, process payment, and schedule deliveries.\nAnother user subscribes to protein powder every 30 days. The system must ensure the order is generated exactly on time without duplication.\nIf a user’s payment fails for a monthly subscription, the system should retry and notify them without affecting other deliveries.\nFor users in the same neighborhood with overlapping daily subscriptions, deliveries should be batched to reduce logistics cost.",

You must adhere to the following constraints:\nYou are not allowed to use any extra data structures (like arrays, lists, queues, etc.) or auxiliary space beyond the internal call stack space naturally used by recursion.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using any loop constructs such as for, for-each, or while loops.\nThe only allowed built-in stack operations are:\npush(x): Adds element x to the top of the stack.\npop(): Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.\ntop(): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.\nInput Format:\nThe first line of input contains an integer N, representing the total number of elements in the stack.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers. These integers represent the stack elements, where the last integer in the sequence is considered the TOP-most element of the initial stack.\nOutput Format:\nPrint N space-separated integers, representing the elements of the reversed stack.

Beyond that, it shouldn’t be assigned any new orders until an ongoing order is completed.\nOnce an order is ACCEPTED, the restaurant can mark it as COMPLETED when the order is ready. This will free up the processing capacity of the restaurant.\nNote:- A restaurant can’t CANCEL an ACCEPTED order.\nOrder will be auto-assigned to a restaurant based on selection criteria.\nEg: Assign by lowest cost or best rating.\nOrder will be auto-assigned to a restaurant only if all the items in an order can be fulfilled by a single restaurant. Else the order will not be ACCEPTED.\nRequirements:\nA new restaurant can be onboarded with a menu.\nA customer should be able to place an order by giving items, respective quantities & selection criteria.\nRestaurants can mark ACCEPTED orders as COMPLETED. Orders once ACCEPTED can’t be CANCELLED by a restaurant.\nOrder will be auto-assigned to a restaurant based on a selection criteria.\nImplement at least one restaurant selection criteria.\nA restaurant should be able to update its menu.

    "description": "You are asked to implement two cache systems – Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU). Each cache must support the following operations:\nGET key – Return the value associated with the key if it exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.\nPUT key value – Insert the key‑value pair into the cache. If the cache reaches its capacity, evict one entry according to the cache policy (LRU or LFU) before inserting the new pair.\nYour program will receive a sequence of commands and must output the result of each GET command.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains two integers N and C – the number of commands and the capacity of the cache.\nThe next N lines each contain a command in one of the following forms:\nGET key\nPUT key value\nAll keys and values are integers.\nOutput Format:\nFor every GET command, print the returned value on a separate line.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n6 2\nPUT 1 10\nPUT 2 20\nGET 1\nPUT 3 30\nGET 2\nGET 3\n\nOutput:\n10\n-1\n30\nExplanation\nAfter the first two puts, the cache contains {1:10, 2:20}.\nGET 1 returns 10 and marks key 1 as most recently used.\nAdding key 3 exceeds capacity, so the least recently used entry (key 2) is evicted.\nGET 2 returns -1 because key 2 was removed.\nGET 3 returns 30.\nExample 2 (LFU behavior):\nInput:\n7 2\nPUT 1 5\nPUT 2 6\nGET 1\nGET 1\nPUT 3 7\nGET 2\nGET 3\n\nOutput:\n5\n5\n-1\n7\nExplanation\nKeys 1 and 2 are inserted.\nGET 1 is called twice, so key 1's access frequency becomes 2, key 2's frequency stays 1.\nWhen inserting key 3, the cache evicts the least frequently used key (key 2).\nSubsequent GET commands reflect the state after eviction.\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵\n1 ≤ C ≤ 10⁵\n0 ≤ key, value ≤ 10⁹\nThe sequence of commands fits in memory.",

    "description": "You are tasked with improving logistics along a coastline by adding new dockyards. You are given an array of integers representing the locations of existing dockyards on a one-dimensional line.\nYour goal is to find the optimal positions to build exactly two new dockyards. A placement is considered optimal if it minimizes the maximum distance from any point on the coastline to its nearest dockyard. Essentially, you want to reduce the largest gap between any two consecutive dockyards as much as possible.\nReturn the locations for the two new dockyards. The order of the returned locations does not matter.\nInput Format:\nAn array of integers representing the locations of existing dockyards.\nOutput Format:\nAn array containing two numbers, representing the locations for the two new dockyards. The result can be floating-point numbers.\nExample 1:\nInput:\narr = [2, 10, 4]\n\nOutput:\n[6.0, 8.0]\n\nExplanation:\nThe initial dockyards are at locations 2, 4, and 10. The largest gap is between 4 and 10, with a length of 6. To minimize the maximum distance, we should place the two new dockyards within this gap to divide it into three equal smaller segments. The new locations would be at 4 + (6/3) = 6.0 and 4 + 2*(6/3) = 8.0. The new set of dockyards becomes [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], and the maximum distance between any two is now 2.\nExample 2:\nInput:\narr = [10, 20, 50]\n\nOutput:\n[30.0, 40.0]\n\nExplanation:\nAfter sorting, the locations are 10, 20, and 50. The gaps are between (10, 20) with length 10, and (20, 50) with length 30. The largest gap is 30. By placing two new dockyards at 30 and 40, we divide the largest gap into three equal parts. The maximum distance between consecutive dockyards becomes 10, which is the optimal solution.\nConstraints:\n2 <= arr.length <= 10^5\n0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9\nAll elements in arr are unique.",

    "description": "It’s a system that is able to do efficient task allocation based on the resources available over the infrastructure.\nProblem Statement:\nYou need to design a system that can track resources available and do effective allocation of resources based on the availability of resources.\nDifferent terminology:\nResource: Can be of different types. For the question purpose, we deal with only the SERVER_INSTANCE type of resources. Each resource will have some pricing and CPU configuration.\nData Center: Data center is location-based storage of resources. All the resources of the same data center reside in a single geographical location.\nTask: Each task will be executed on a single/multiple SERVER_INSTANCE type of resource. Systems can be asked to execute the task on one (single instance)/multiple resources (multiple instances) simultaneously. Resources can be demanded based on high or low cpu intensive use cases. Whenever a task is submitted the minimum cpu configuration requirement needs to be passed. A resource can execute a single task at a time. As soon as the task is complete, resources become available for further tasks.\nRequirements P0\nAll the below requirements are for a given data center.\nProvide an interface to add/delete different types of resources to the data center.\nProvide an interface to see all the available resources based on the resource type and resource type-specific configuration filter.\ne.g. SERVER_INSTANCE, 8 (CPU)\nReturn a list of resources available having at least these configurations.\nProvide an interface to see all the allocated resources based on the resource type. e.g. SERVER_INSTANCE\nFor a given task, allocate a single resource and execute the task on the resource.\nResource allocation can be done through different criteria.\nCriteria 1: allocate the resources having the least price.\nCriteria 2: allocate the resources having the best execution time.\nFor simplicity, the execution time can be considered inversely proportional to (CPU) Satisfying minimum configuration requirements is important apart from these criteria.\nAn interface to check the status of the task, resources allocated, and start and end time.\nHandle error scenarios appropriately.\nPlease remember: You are expected to write the system which mirrors production quality code, rather than just implementing these functions.\nRequirements P1\nHandle concurrency cases for different scenarios.\nIf the resource is not available, Put the task in the waiting queue and wait for the resources to be available. Assign the task in a FIFO manner based on their matching configuration to the free resource. You can choose to do a non-blocking task submission in this case.\nMake your code generic to handle the allocation of more than one resource based on the given criteria for future use cases.\nThings to keep in mind\nYou are only allowed to use in-memory data structures.\nYou are NOT allowed to use any databases.\nYou are NOT required to have a full-fledged web service or APIs exposed.\nA working code is NECESSARY. Evaluation will not be done if your code is not running. So ensure you time yourselves accordingly.\nYou are required to showcase the work of the above concept.\nJust a main class that simulates the above operations is enough.\nShould you have any doubts, you are allowed to make appropriate assumptions, as long as you can explain them during the evaluation.\nYou can code on your favorite IDEs as long as you paste the code back into the tool within the allotted time frame.\nHow you will be evaluated\nYou are expected to write production-quality code while implementing the requirements. We look for the following:\nSeparation of concerns\nAbstractions\nApplication of OO design principles\nTestability\nCode readability\nLanguage proficiency\n[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)\n[memory limit] 1 GB",

The goal is to design an efficient and modular class hierarchy that facilitates the sending and receiving of notifications while adhering to object-oriented design principles.\nRequirements:\nUsers: The system should support users, each identified by a unique user ID. Users can subscribe to different types of notifications and manage their notification preferences.\nNotification Channels: The system should support multiple notification channels, such as email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app notifications. Each channel has its own delivery mechanism and requirements.\nNotification Types: Users can subscribe to different types of notifications, such as new messages, friend requests, system alerts, or custom events. Each notification type may have specific content and delivery requirements.\nBonus Requirements:\nPersonalization: Notifications may need to be personalized with user-specific information, such as the user's name or specific details related to the notification type.\nOpt-out and Preferences: Users should have the ability to opt out of specific notification types or unsubscribe from the notification service altogether. They should be able to manage their notification preferences, such as frequency or delivery channels.\nDesign and implement the class structure that satisfies the above requirements. Consider the following aspects:\nIdentify the classes and interfaces required for the notification system.\nDefine the relationships between the classes and their responsibilities.\nIncorporate appropriate encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism principles.\nEnsure the classes adhere to SOLID principles and promote loose coupling and high cohesion.\nConsider extensibility and modularity to accommodate future changes or additions to the notification system.\nYour design should focus on class structure and organization while promoting code reusability and maintainability.

These offers can include bonuses, discounts, or referral rewards.\nExtensibility: The design should be flexible and extensible to accommodate future changes and additions to the payout system, such as new types of offers or payout calculation rules.\nReusability: The code should be modular and reusable to ensure efficient development and maintenance.\nYour task is to design the classes, interfaces, and relationships that would best represent the driver payout management system, considering the requirements mentioned above. You should focus on creating an architecture that supports code extendability, reusability, and is production-ready.\nPlease provide the following in your design:\nClass definitions with appropriate attributes and methods.\nInterfaces or abstract classes to represent common behaviors and enforce modularity.\nRelationships between classes to establish proper connections and dependencies.\nAppropriate algorithms or logic for payout calculation and offer application.\nNote: You do not need to provide a complete implementation of the system, but your design should demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and showcase your ability to create a scalable and extensible solution.",

The adjacent letters can be horizontally or vertically neighboring, but not diagonally.\nImplement a function, exist, that takes the grid and the word as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the word can be found in the grid.\nFunction Signature: boolean exist(char[][] board, String word)\nExample 1: Grid:\n[\n  ['A', 'B', 'C', 'E'],\n  ['S', 'F', 'C', 'S'],\n  ['A', 'D', 'E', 'E']\n]\nWord: \"ABCCED\"\nIn the given example, the grid consists of letters forming a 3x4 matrix. The word to search for is \"ABCCED\". By traversing adjacent letters in the grid, we can form the word by starting at 'A', moving to 'B', then 'C', 'C', 'E', and finally 'D'. Therefore, the function exist should return true.\nExample 2: Grid:\n[\n  ['A', 'B', 'C', 'E'],\n  ['S', 'F', 'C', 'S'],\n  ['A', 'D', 'E', 'E']\n]\nWord: \"SEE\"\nIn this example, the grid is the same as in Example 1.

However, it is not possible to form the word \"ABCB\" by traversing adjacent letters in the grid. Therefore, the function exist should return false.\nNote:\nThe grid can contain both uppercase and lowercase letters.\nThe word can contain both uppercase and lowercase letters.\nThe word can be formed by connecting adjacent letters in any direction (horizontally or vertically), but not diagonally.\nEach letter in the grid can only be used once to form the word.",

    "description": "You have been tasked with designing a scalable and efficient system for the CarWale News website. CarWale is a popular online platform that provides news and updates related to the automotive industry. The goal is to create a system that can handle a large number of users concurrently while delivering news articles in a timely manner.\nRequirements:\nUser Management: The system should support user registration, login, and authentication to provide personalized experiences for users. Users should be able to customize their news preferences and receive relevant recommendations.\nNews Article Management: The system should allow administrators to create, edit, and publish news articles. Each article should have a title, content, author, publication date, and associated tags for categorization. Articles should be searchable based on keywords and tags.\nNews Feed: The system should provide a personalized news feed for each user based on their preferences and browsing history. The news feed should display the latest articles from various categories, including breaking news, industry updates, reviews, and more.\nSocial Features: Users should be able to like, share, and comment on news articles. The system should support real-time updates for interactions such as likes and comments. Users should also have the option to follow authors and receive notifications when new articles are published by their favorite authors.\nPerformance and Scalability: The system should be able to handle a high volume of concurrent users and deliver news articles quickly. It should be designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to handle increasing traffic. Caching mechanisms should be implemented to improve response times and reduce the load on the database.\nAnalytics and Reporting: The system should track user interactions, such as views, likes, shares, and comments, to generate analytics and reports. Administrators should have access to data such as popular articles, user engagement, and trending topics to make data-driven decisions.\nSecurity: The system should implement robust security measures to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and mitigate potential attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). User passwords should be securely stored using hashing and salting techniques.\nMobile-Friendly Interface: The website should be responsive and optimized for mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience across different screen sizes and resolutions.\nDesign Considerations:\nThe system should be designed for high availability and fault tolerance to minimize downtime and ensure reliability.\nLoad balancing techniques should be employed to distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers.\nA content delivery network (CDN) can be utilized to improve content delivery speeds, especially for static assets like images and CSS files.\nAs the number of articles and users grows, database sharding or partitioning strategies may be employed to distribute the load across multiple database servers.\nThe system should have an efficient search mechanism to retrieve relevant articles based on user queries and filters.\nData backups and disaster recovery plans should be in place to prevent data loss.\nNote: You do not need to provide detailed technical specifications or code implementation. Focus on the high-level design and architecture of the system.",

    "description": "Problem Statement: Database Schema for News Website\nYou are designing the database schema for a news website. The website needs to store various types of data related to news articles, authors, categories, and user interactions. Your task is to design an efficient and scalable database schema to meet the requirements of the news website.\nRequirements:\nNews Articles: The database should store information about news articles, including the article title, content, publication date, author, category, and associated tags. Each article should have a unique identifier.\nAuthors: The database should store information about authors who write news articles. Each author should have a unique identifier, name, email address, and other relevant details.\nCategories: The database should store information about categories or topics to which news articles can be assigned. Each category should have a unique identifier and a name.\nTags: The database should store information about tags associated with news articles. Tags are used to categorize articles based on specific keywords or topics. Each tag should have a unique identifier and a name.\nUser Interactions: The database should track user interactions with news articles, including likes, shares, comments, and views. Each interaction should be associated with a specific user and a news article.\nUser Accounts: The database should store information about registered users of the website, including their username, email address, password (hashed and salted), and any other relevant details.\nUser Preferences: The database should store user preferences for news article categories or tags. This information will be used to personalize the news feed for each user.\nDesign Considerations:\nThe database schema should be normalized to minimize redundancy and ensure data consistency.\nEfficient indexing and querying mechanisms should be implemented to retrieve articles based on different criteria such as category, tag, author, and publication date.\nThe database should be designed to handle a high volume of read and write operations efficiently.\nAppropriate relationships (such as one-to-many and many-to-many) should be established between entities (tables) to represent their associations accurately.\nSecurity measures should be implemented to protect sensitive user information and prevent unauthorized access to the database.\nThe schema should allow for easy scalability as the website's data and userbase grow.\nYour task is to design the database schema for the news website, considering the requirements and design considerations mentioned above. Provide an overview of the entities (tables), their attributes, and the relationships between them. You can use any notation (such as an Entity-Relationship Diagram or a tabular representation) to illustrate your schema.\nNote: You do not need to provide detailed SQL table creation statements or specific data types for attributes. Focus on the logical design of the schema.",

Your goal is to eliminate all the balls on the track.\nThe track is represented by a string of characters, where each character represents a colored ball. You can insert the balls from your hand into the track at any position.\nTo eliminate balls, you need to form groups of three or more consecutive balls of the same color. Once a group is formed, it will be removed from the track, and the track will collapse to fill in the gaps.\nHowever, there is a limitation. You can only insert balls from your hand if it will lead to the immediate elimination of a group of balls. In other words, you cannot insert balls if it will not result in any elimination.\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of balls you need to insert from your hand in order to eliminate all the balls on the track. If it is not possible to eliminate all the balls, return -1.\nWrite a function or algorithm to solve the Zuma game problem and return the minimum number of balls to be inserted from your hand.\nExample 1:\nInput:  \"WRRBBWW\", hand = \"RB\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: You can insert the \"R\" ball at index 3, forming \"WRRRBBWW\".

Return the quotient after dividing the dividend by the divisor. If the quotient overflows, return the maximum integer value.\"\nExample 1:\nInput:\ndividend = 10, divisor = 3\n\nOutput:\n3\n\nExplanation:\nIn this example, the dividend is 10 and the divisor is 3. The division of 10 by 3 results in a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 1. Since the problem requires us to return only the quotient, the output is 3.\nExample 2:\nInput:\ndividend = 7, divisor = -2\n\nOutput:\n-3\n\nExplanation:\nIn this example, the dividend is 7 and the divisor is -2. The division of 7 by -2 results in a quotient of -3 with a remainder of 1. The remainder is ignored as per the problem requirements, and thus the output is -3.\nExample 3:\nInput:\ndividend = -2147483648, divisor = 1\n\nOutput:\n-2147483648\n\nExplanation:\nIn this example, the dividend is the minimum integer value, -2147483648, and the divisor is 1.

An alternating sequence is defined as a sequence where the elements alternate between positive and negative numbers.\nThe expected time complexity of the solution: O(N)\nExample 1:\nInput:\nArray: [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, 7]\n\nOutput:\nLength of Maximum Alternating Sequence: 7\n\nExplanation:\nIn this example, we can form multiple alternating sequences by starting from different indices in the array. One possible solution is to start from index 0 and form the sequence [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, 7], which has a length of 7. Another possible solution is to start from index 1 and form the sequence [-2, 3, -4, 5, -6, 7], which also has a length of 6. Since we need to find the maximum length of the alternating sequence starting from every index, the output is 7.\nExample 2:\nInput:\nArray: [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]\n\nOutput:\nLength of Maximum Alternating Sequence: 1\n\nExplanation:\nIn this example, the array consists of only negative numbers.

    "description": "Given a 2D matrix representing a grid of cells, each containing a non-negative integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, find the maximum amount of gold that can be collected while moving from the starting cell at {1,1} to the destination cell at {n,m}.\nYou can only move either downwards or rightwards in each step.\nExpected time complexity: O(N^2), where N represents the size of the grid.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nGrid:\n[\n  [1, 3, 1],\n  [2, 2, 4],\n  [5, 0, 2]\n]\n\nOutput:\nMaximum Gold Collected: 12\n\nExplanation:\nIn this example, the grid represents a 3x3 matrix where each cell contains the amount of gold in that cell. Starting from the top-left cell at {1,1} and moving towards the bottom-right cell at {3,3}, the maximum amount of gold that can be collected is 12. One possible path to collect the maximum gold is: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3). The total gold collected in this path is 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 12.\nExample 2:\nInput:\nGrid:\n[\n  [1, 2],\n  [0, 3]\n]\n\nOutput:\nMaximum Gold Collected: 6\n\nExplanation:\nIn this example, the grid represents a 2x2 matrix. By following the path (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2), the maximum amount of gold that can be collected is 6. The total gold collected in this path is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.",

    "description": "Design a scalable and robust system that provides analytics for website traffic, similar to Google Analytics. Your system should be able to handle a high volume of requests, process and store data efficiently, and provide real-time insights to website owners.\nRequirements:\nData Collection: The system should be able to collect data from various websites and track user interactions, such as page views, clicks, and events. This data should be sent to the analytics service in real-time or near real-time.\nData Processing and Storage: The collected data needs to be processed and stored efficiently. The system should support distributed processing and storage techniques to handle large volumes of data. Consider technologies like Apache Kafka for data ingestion, Apache Spark or Apache Flink for data processing, and a scalable database solution like Apache Cassandra or Google Bigtable for data storage.\nAnalytics Dashboard: Provide a user-friendly dashboard where website owners can access insights and metrics about their website traffic. The dashboard should include features like real-time visitor count, popular pages, traffic sources, user demographics, conversion rates, and custom event tracking.\nScalability and High Availability: The system should be designed to handle a high volume of traffic and be highly available. Consider using load balancing, horizontal scaling, and distributed caching techniques to ensure system resilience and performance.\nSecurity and Privacy: Ensure that the system complies with security and privacy regulations, such as data encryption, user consent management, and anonymization of personally identifiable information (PII).\nReal-time Reporting: Provide real-time reporting capabilities, allowing website owners to monitor their website traffic and metrics as they happen.\nData Visualization: Include data visualization tools that allow users to create custom reports, charts, and graphs to visualize their website analytics data.\nAPI Integration: Offer APIs that allow website owners to integrate analytics data into their own applications or third-party services.\nConsiderations:\nHow will you handle high write throughput and ensure data consistency in a distributed system?\nHow will you handle data retention and archiving to manage storage costs?\nHow will you handle data privacy and comply with regulations like GDPR?\nHow will you ensure the system's performance and responsiveness even during peak traffic?",

The app keeps balances between people as in who owes how much to whom.\nExample:\nYou live with 3 other friends.\nYou: User1 (id: u1)\nFlatmates: User2 (u2), User3 (u3), User4 (u4)\nThis month's electricity bill was Rs. 1000.\nNow you can just go to the app and add that you paid 1000, select all 4 people and then select split equally.\nInput: u1 1000 4 u1 u2 u3 u4 EQUAL\nFor this transaction, everyone owes 250 to User1.\nThe app should update the balances in each of the profiles accordingly.\nUser2 owes User1: 250 (0+250) \nUser3 owes User1: 250 (0+250) \nUser4 owes User1: 250 (0+250) \nNow, you go on a trip and you pay for the food , for User2 and User3 as they asked you to. The total amount for each person is different.\nInput: u1 1250 2 u2 u3 EXACT 370 880 \nFor this transaction, User2 owes 370 to User1 and User3 owes 880 to User1.\nThe app should update the balances in each of the profiles accordingly.\nUser2 owes User1: 620 (250+370) \nUser3 owes User1: 1130 (250+880) \nUser4 owes User1: 250 (250+0)\nRequirements:\nUser: Each user should have a userId, name, email, mobile number.\nExpense: Could either be EQUAL, EXACT\nUsers can add any amount, select any type of expense, and split with any of the available users.\nIn the case of exact, you need to verify if the total sum of shares is equal to the total amount or not.\nThe application should have the capability to show expenses for a single user as well as balances for everyone.\nWhen asked to show balances, the application should show the balances of a user with all the users where there is a non-zero balance.\nThe amount should be rounded off to two decimal places. Say if User1 paid 100 and amount is split equally among 3 people. Assign 33.34 to first-person and 33.33 to others.\nInput:\nYou can create a few users in your main method. No need to take it as input. There will be 3 types of input:\nExpense in the format:\nEXPENSE <user-id-of-person-who-paid> <no-of-users> <space-separated-list-of-users> EQUAL\nEXPENSE <user-id-of-person-who-paid> <no-of-users> <space-separated-list-of-users> <space-separated-values-in-case-of-non-equal> EXACT\nShow balances for all: SHOW\nShow balances for a single user: SHOW <user-id>\nOutput:\nWhen asked to show balance for a single user. Show all the balances that user is part of: Format: <user-id-of-x> owes <user-id-of-y>: <amount>\nIf there are no balances for the input, print No balances\nIn cases where the user for which balance was asked for, owes money, they’ll be x. They’ll be y otherwise.\nSample Input:\nSHOW \nSHOW user1 \nEXPENSE user1 1000 4 user1 user2 user3 user4 EQUAL \nSHOW user4 \nSHOW user1 \nEXPENSE user1 1250 2 user2 user3 EXACT 370 880 \nSHOW \nSHOW user1 \nSHOW\nSample Output:\nNo balances \nNo balances \nUser4 owes User1: 250 \nUser2 owes User1: 250 \nUser3 owes User1: 250 \nUser4 owes User1: 250 \nUser2 owes User1: 620 \nUser3 owes User1: 1130 \nUser4 owes User1: 250 \nUser1 owes User4: 230 \nUser2 owes User1: 620 \nUser3 owes User1: 1130 \nUser1 owes User4: 230 \nUser2 owes User1: 620 \nUser2 owes User4: 240 \nUser3 owes User1: 1130 \nUser3 owes User4: 240 \nExpectations:\nClean and object-oriented low-level design.\nAppropriate coding conventions and directory structure wrt language used.

    "description": "You are given an array of integers in which no two elements are the same. Your task is to implement an algorithm to find the next permutation of the array in lexicographical order.\nA permutation is an arrangement of elements. The next permutation is defined as the rearrangement of the elements such that it forms the smallest possible integer greater than the given permutation.\nIf no next permutation is possible, the algorithm should rearrange the array in ascending order, considering it as the lowest possible permutation.\nWrite a function nextPermutation(nums: List[int]) -> List[int] to implement the algorithm. The function should modify the input array in-place and return the modified array.\nExample: 1\nInput: nums = [1, 2, 3]\nOutput: [1, 3, 2]\nExplanation: The next permutation after [1, 2, 3] is [1, 3, 2], which is the smallest integer greater than the given permutation.\nExample: 2\nInput: nums = [1, 1, 5]\nOutput: [1, 5, 1]\nNote:\nThe input array nums will have at least two elements and will contain only unique integers.\nThe algorithm should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.",

    "description": "Design text-based cricket game using text as the game's interface. Users will be able to control the game via text-based commands because it will be played on a console or terminal. The objective is to develop a simple, two-player cricket game that is interactive.\nRequirement :\n1- Game Setup:\nThe game should start by asking the players to enter their names.\nRandomly select which player will bat first.\n2-Batting and Bowling:\nAlternating between batting and bowling turns for the players should be the rule for the game.\nShow the current bowler, batsman, and (if applicable) the target to be chased.\nIn order to play a certain shot (such as defend, straight drive, or cover drive), the user must enter the appropriate commands when the batter is facing the ball during batting.\n3- Scoring and Targets:\nKeep track of the score for both players.\nSet a target for the chasing player in case of the second inning.\n4- Wickets and Innings:\nEach player has a limited number of wickets (e.g., 10) per inning.\nThe game should switch to the second inning after the first inning concludes, with players swapping roles (bowling to batting and vice versa).\nThe game should end once both innings are completed, and the winner should be declared based on the total score.\n5- Input Validation:\nThe game should handle incorrect or invalid user inputs gracefully and prompt the player to re-enter the correct input.\n6- Game End:\nAfter both innings are completed, display the final scores and announce the winner.\nAsk players if they want to play again and restart the game accordingly.",

Each trip is represented by three integers numPassengers[i], from[i], and to[i], where numPassengers[i] indicates the number of passengers for the ith trip, and from[i] and to[i] represent the locations to pick them up and drop them off, respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.\nThe car can only drive east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

    "description": "You have to design and implement a Vehicle Rental Service which allows users to rent a given type of Vehicle for a given time slot.\nRequirements:\nThis Vehicle Rental Service will be operational only in one city (Delhi) which will have multiple branches (eg. Vasant Vihar Branch, CP branch, etc).\nEach branch can have three different types of vehicles (VehicleType): Sedan, Hatchback, SUV. There could be any number of vehicles of each type in a branch.\nThe rental price per hour should be defined at “per branch per vehicle type” level and NOT at an individual vehicle level. (eg. Sedan in CP branch = 150 rs/hr, Sedan in Vasant Vihar = 100 rs/hr, Hatchback in CP = 80rs/hr and so on)\nA user can request to rent a particular vehicle type for a given time slot. You will have to allot the vehicle from one of the branches if available for the given time slot with the “lowest rental price” strategy.\nThe following APIs have to be implemented: Note: The given parameters are the mandatory parameters, you are free to add more parameters as part of your APIs if you feel the need to do so. The return type of each API is up to you but make sure it provides the relevant information needed.\naddBranch(branchName)\nThis will add a new branch for your Service.\nallocatePrice(branchName, vehicleType, price);\nThis will be used to define price per vehicle type per branch\naddVehicle(vehicleId, vehicleType, branchName);\nThis will add a new vehicle of the given vehicle type in a given existing branch.\nbookVehicle(vehicleType, startTime, endTime)\nThis will be used to rent a vehicle for the given vehicle type for a given time slot defined by Start time and end time. You can expect the start time and endTime to be in hourly slots only.\n[Optional]viewVehicleInventory(startTime, endTime):\nThis will give a snapshot of the inventory for the given time slot i.e. all the vehicles that are available and all the vehicles that are not available categorised by vehicleType.\nGuidelines:\nYou should store the data in-memory using a language-specific data-structure.\nYou can print the output in console.\nDesign your application in a way that a new rental Strategy can be implemented and used instead of the default one (lowest price).\nImplement clear separation between your data layers and service layers.\nYou can take the startTime and endTime as DateTime or in any other way as you prefer.\nThe start time and end time will be in hourly granularity only.\nExpectations:\nYour code should cover all the mandatory functionalities explained above.\nYour code should be executable and clean.\nYour code should be properly refactored, and exceptions should be gracefully handled.\nHow will you be evaluated?\nCode Should be working\nCode readability and testability\nSeparation Of Concerns\nAbstraction\nObject-Oriented concepts.\nLanguage proficiency.\nScalability\nConcurrency handling (Bonus Points)\nTest Coverage (Bonus Points)\nSample Execution:\naddBranch(“Vasanth Vihar”)\naddBranch(“Cyber City”)\nallocatePrice(“Vasanth Vihar”, VehicleType.Sedan, 100)\nallocatePrice(“Vasanth Vihar”, VehicleType.Hatchback, 80)\nallocatePrice(“Cyber City”, VehicleType.Sedan, 200)\nallocatePrice(“Cyber City”, VehicleType.Hatchback, 50)\naddVehicle(“DL 01 MR 9310”, VehicleType.Sedan, “Vasanth Vihar”)\naddVehicle(“DL 01 MR 9311”, VehicleType.Sedan, “Cyber City”)\naddVehicle(“DL 01 MR 9312”, VehicleType.Hatchback, “Cyber City”)\nbookVehicle(VehicleType.Sedan, 29-02-2020 10:00 AM, 29-02-2020 01:00 PM)\n\n“DL 01 MR 9310” from Vasanth Vihar booked.\n\nNote: Since the strategy is lowest price first, the sedan was allocated from Vasanth Vihar as the >>>price is lower as compared to Cyber City Branch.\n\nbookVehicle(VehicleType.Sedan, 29-02-2020 02:00 PM, 29-02-2020 03:00 PM)\n\n“DL 01 MR 9310” from Vasanth Vihar booked.\n\nbookVehicle(VehicleType.Sedan, 29-02-2020 02:00 PM, 29-02-2020 03:00 PM)\n\n“DL 01 MR 9311” from Cyber City booked.\n\nbookVehicle(VehicleType.Sedan, 29-02-2020 02:00 PM, 29-02-2020 03:00 PM)\n\nNO SEDAN AVAILABLE\n\nviewInventory(29-02-2020 02:00 PM, 29-02-2020 03:00 PM)\n\nBranch: Vasanth Vihar\nSedan DL 01 MR 9310 Booked\nHatchback DL 01 MR 9312 Available\nBranch: Cyber City\nSedan DL 01 MR 9311 Booked\n\nviewInventory(29-02-2020 04:00 PM, 29-02-2020 05:00 PM)\n\nBranch: Vasanth Vihar\nSedan DL 01 MR 9310 Available\nHatchback DL 01 MR 9312 Available\nBranch: Cyber City\nSedan DL 01 MR 9311 Available",

    "description": "You are given a forest with n trees. The heights of the trees are stored in an array trees[], where trees[i] denotes the height of the ith tree in the forest. If the ith tree is cut at a height H, then the amount of wood collected is trees[i] - H, provided trees[i] > H. Your task is to find the height H at which every tree should be cut (all trees have to be cut at the same height) such that the total wood collected is exactly equal to k. If it is not possible to collect exactly k units of wood, return -1; otherwise, return the height H.\nInput:\ntrees: A list of integers representing the heights of the trees in the forest. (1 ≤ len(trees) ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ trees[i] ≤ 10^6)\nk: An integer representing the total wood that needs to be collected. (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^9)\nOutput:\nAn integer representing the height H at which every tree should be cut. If it is not possible to collect exactly k units of wood, return -1.\nExample 1:\ntrees[] = [3, 6, 2, 8, 7]\nk = 15\nOutput: -1\n\nExplanation:\nIn the given example, if we cut all trees at \nFor H=6, we collect wood (3-6) + (6-6) + (2-6) + (8-6) + (7-6) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 3 units of wood, which is less than k = 15. \nFor H=5, we collect wood (3-5) + (6-5) + (2-5) + (8-5) + (7-5) = 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 2 = 6 units of wood, which is less than k = 15. \nFor H=4, we collect wood (3-4) + (6-4) + (2-4) + (8-4) + (7-4) = 0 + 2 + 0 + 4 + 3 = 9 units of wood, which is less than k = 15. \nFor H=3, we collect wood (3-3) + (6-3) + (2-3) + (8-3) + (7-3) = 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 4 = 12 units of wood, which is less than k = 15. \nFor H=2, we collect wood (3-2) + (6-2) + (2-2) + (8-2) + (7-2) = 1 + 4 + 0 + 6 + 5 = 16 units of wood, which is more than k = 15. \nIf we reduce H further, total would collected will further increase.\nTherefore, there is no H possible, hence ans is -1.\nExample 2:\nInput:\ntrees[] = [2, 3, 6, 2, 4]\nk = 4\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Wood collected by cutting trees at height 3 = 0 + 0 + (6-3) + 0 + (4-3) = 4",

If the stack is empty when pop, top, or getMin is called, print EMPTY for that query.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n7\npush 5\npush 3\npush 7\ngetMin\npop\ntop\ngetMin\n\nOutput:\n3\n5\n3\nExplanation\nAfter pushing 5, 3, 7 the stack is [5, 3, 7] (top is 7). getMin returns 3.\npop removes 7, stack becomes [5, 3]. top returns 3.\ngetMin still returns 3, the smallest element.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n5\npush 2\npop\ntop\npush 1\ngetMin\n\nOutput:\nEMPTY\n1\nExplanation\nAfter pushing 2 and popping it, the stack is empty, so top prints EMPTY.\nPushing 1 makes the stack non‑empty; getMin returns 1.\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ Q ≤ 10^5\n-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9\nAll operations must run in O(1) time per query.",

    "description": "You are planning a circular road trip and have a car with an unlimited gas tank. Along the circular route, there are n gas stations, and the amount of gas at the ith station is given by the array gas. Additionally, it costs cost[i] units of gas to travel from the ith station to its next station (i + 1) in the clockwise direction.\nYou must start your journey at one of the gas stations and travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction. Your goal is to determine the starting gas station's index, such that you can complete the trip without running out of gas.\nWrite a function findStartingGasStation to find the starting gas station's index. If a valid starting station exists, return its index; otherwise, return -1. If there is a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.\nThe function should take two integer arrays as input:\ngas: An array representing the amount of gas at each station (positive integers).\ncost: An array representing the cost of travel between stations (positive integers).\nExample 1:\nInput: \ngas [ ] = [1,2,3,4,5], \ncost[ ] = [3,4,5,1,2]\n\nOutput:  3\n\nExplanation:\n- Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 units of gas. \n- Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\n- Travel to station 4. Tank gas = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8\n- Travel to station 0. Tank gas = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7\n- Travel to station 1. Tank gas = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6\n- Travel to station 2. Tank gas = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5\n- Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. \n- Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.\n\nThus, starting at index 3, you’ll be able to make a complete circular traversal.\nExample 2:\nInput:\ngas[] = [2, 3, 4],\ncost[] = [3, 4, 3]\n\nOutput:\n-1\n\nExplanation:\nNo matter which gas station you start from, you will not have enough gas to complete the circuit without running out.",

    "description": "The count-and-say sequence is a unique sequence of digit strings that follows a recursive formula. To generate a count-and-say sequence, we start with the base case: countAndSay(1) = \"1\". To calculate countAndSay(n) for n greater than 1, we take the result from countAndSay(n-1) and \"say\" it according to certain rules.\nTo \"say\" a digit string, we split it into the minimal number of substrings, with each substring containing exactly one unique digit. For each of these substrings, we count the number of consecutive occurrences of that digit and then say the digit itself. Finally, we concatenate the results for all substrings to create the count-and-say representation.\nInput:\nAn integer n (1 <= n <= 30), representing the position of the count-and-say sequence to generate.\nOutput:\nA string representing countAndSay(n), the count-and-say sequence at position n.\nExample1:\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: \"1\"\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: \"1211\"\nExplanation: \n  - countAndSay(1) = \"1\"\n  - countAndSay(2) = \"11\" (one 1), \n  - countAndSay(3) = \"21\" (two 1s), \n  - countAndSay(4) = \"1211\" (one 2, then one 1).\nExample 3:\nInput: n = 6\nOutput: \"312211\"\nExplanation:\nExplanation: \n  - countAndSay(1) = \"1\"\n  - countAndSay(2) = \"11\" (one 1), \n  - countAndSay(3) = \"21\" (two 1s), \n  - countAndSay(4) = \"1211\" (one 2, then one 1).\n  - countAndSay(5) = \"111221\" (one 1, one 2, two 1s),\n  - countAndSay(6) = \"312211\" (three 1s, two 2s, one 1).",

A connection pool is a crucial component for improving the performance and resource utilization of database connections, particularly in applications where multiple threads may require concurrent database access. Your design should ensure that multiple threads can safely acquire, use, and release database connections without conflicts or contention.\nDesign Requirements:\nConnection Pool Management:\nCreate and maintain a pool of database connections.\nLimit the maximum number of connections in the pool to prevent resource exhaustion.\nThread Safety:\nImplement mechanisms to make the connection pool thread-safe.\nEnsure that multiple threads can safely request and release connections without data corruption or resource leaks.\nConnection Reuse:\nReuse connections to minimize the overhead of creating and destroying connections for each database request.\nConnection Validation:\nValidate connections before handing them to requesting threads to ensure they are in a usable state.\nTimeouts and Wait Strategies:\nHandle cases where all connections in the pool are in use, including timeouts and wait strategies for thread contention.\nResource Cleanup:\nEnsure that connections are properly released and resources are cleaned up when connections are closed or returned to the pool.\nCompatibility:\nThe connection pool should be compatible with different database systems and connection libraries.\nExample:\n// Example of using a thread-safe connection pool in Java\nConnectionPool pool = new ConnectionPool(\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb\", \"username\", \"password\");\ntry (Connection connection = pool.getConnection()) {\n    // Use the connection for database operations\n    // ...\n} catch (SQLException e) {\n    // Handle exceptions\n} finally {\n    pool.releaseConnection(connection);\n}",

Each meeting needs to be held in a separate room if there is an overlap in time with another meeting.\nThe intervals are in the form:\n[s1, e1], [s2, e2], ...\nExample 1:\nInput: intervals = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n- Meeting 1: [0, 30]\n- Meeting 2: [5, 10]\n- Meeting 3: [15, 20]\n- Meetings 1 and 2 overlap, so they need separate rooms.\n- Meetings 1 and 3 do not overlap, but Meetings 2 and 3 do. Therefore, at least 2 rooms are required.\nExample 2:\nInput: intervals = [[7, 10], [2, 4]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\n- Meeting 1: [7, 10]\n- Meeting 2: [2, 4]\n- Since these meetings do not overlap, only one room is needed.\nExample 3:\nInput: intervals = [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\n- Meeting 1: [1, 4]\n- Meeting 2: [2, 5]\n- Meeting 3: [3, 6]\n- All meetings overlap with each other, so three separate rooms are required.",

    "description": "Given a string s, an integer k, and a boolean value isLeft, the task is to rotate the string by k positions. If isLeft is true, the string should be rotated to the left; otherwise, it should be rotated to the right. Rotating a string means shifting characters by the specified number of positions and wrapping around the ends of the string.\nFor example, rotating the string abcde to the left by 1 position results in bcdea, while rotating it to the right by 1 position results in eabcd. Implement a function that performs this rotation and returns the resulting string.\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"hello\", k = 2, isLeft = true  \nOutput: \"llohe\"  \nExplanation: Rotating the string \"hello\" to the left by 2 positions results in \"llohe\".\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"rotation\", k = 4, isLeft = false  \nOutput: \"tionrota\"  \nExplanation: Rotating the string \"rotation\" to the right by 4 positions results in \"tionrota\".\nExample 3:\nInput: s = \"abcdef\", k = 1, isLeft = true  \nOutput: \"bcdefa\"  \nExplanation: Rotating the string \"abcdef\" to the left by 1 position results in \"bcdefa\".",

    "description": "In a given functional graph where each node has at most one outgoing edge, your task is to find the maximum sum of edge weights in any cycle within the graph. A functional graph is a special kind of directed graph where every vertex has exactly one outgoing edge, which may lead to scenarios including self-loops and cycles.\nThe cycle with the highest sum of its constituent edge weights should be identified, and its sum returned. If the graph does not contain any cycles, the function should return 0.\nInput of edges is given where each edge is represented as: (srcNode, destNode, weight)\nExample 1:\nInput: edges = [(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 1, 5)]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: The graph contains a single cycle 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 with edge weights 3, 4, and 5 respectively. The maximum sum of edge weights in this cycle is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.\nExample 2:\nInput: edges = [(1, 2, 1), (3, 4, 2), (4, 3, 3)]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: There are two cycles in the graph: one with no edges and another 3 -> 4 -> 3 with edge weights 2 and 3. The maximum sum of edge weights in a cycle is 2 + 3 = 5.\nExample 3:\nInput: edges = [(1, 1, 7)]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: The graph contains a single cycle, which is a self-loop 1 -> 1 with an edge weight of 7. The maximum sum of edge weights in this cycle is 7.",

    "description": "Develop a small React application that initially displays three buttons, each with its own individual counter, along with a global counter. The global counter should reflect the sum of the counts from all individual buttons.\nThe application must be dynamic, allowing for the addition or removal of buttons as needed, with the global counter updating in real-time to reflect the current total sum of all individual button counters.\nRequirements:\nInitial Setup: Start with three buttons, each labeled with a number starting from 1 (e.g., \"Button 1\", \"Button 2\", \"Button 3\") and a global counter displayed at the top or bottom of the page.\nIndividual Counters: Clicking on a button should increment its associated counter by 1.\nGlobal Counter: Display a global counter that shows the sum of the counts from all individual buttons. This counter must update in real-time as individual buttons are clicked.\nDynamic Buttons: Implement functionality to add and remove buttons dynamically. Each new button should follow the same labeling convention and have its own individual counter initialized at 0.\nState Management: Manage the state of the individual counters and the global counter efficiently to ensure the application can handle a dynamic number of buttons without significant performance degradation.\nExample Scenario:\nOn initial load, the application shows 3 buttons and a global counter.\nClicking \"Button 1\" increases its counter by 1 and updates the global counter.\nThe user adds a new button, \"Button 4\", which also interacts with the global counter as described.\nIf the counts are 5, 3, 2, and 4 for Buttons 1 through 4, respectively, the global counter should display 14.\nIf \"Button 2\" is removed, the global counter should adjust to reflect the sum of the remaining buttons' counts.\nThis problem challenges you to think about component reusability, state management across multiple components, and dynamic rendering based on the application's state in React.",

The function should identify and return all unique error codes that occur more than N times within any one-hour (3600 seconds) interval.\nThe input will be provided as a list of tuples, with each tuple consisting of an error code and a timestamp, and an integer N representing the frequency threshold.\nRequirements:\nInput Format: The function should accept a list of tuples (errorCode, timestamp) and an integer N. Each tuple represents an error log entry, where errorCode is an integer and timestamp is an epoch timestamp in seconds.\nFrequency Threshold: An error code should be reported if it appears more than N times within any one-hour interval throughout the list.\nOutput: Return a list of unique error codes that meet the frequency threshold within any one-hour interval. The order of error codes in the output list is not important.\nExample:\nInput: logs = [(503, 31536000), (503, 31536001), (503, 31536002), (400, 31536022), (500, 31536022), (500, 31536032)], N = 2\nOutput: [503]\nExplanation: In this example, error code 503 occurs twice within a one-hour interval starting at timestamp 31536000.

    "description": "Imagine a network of water pipes modelled as an n-ary tree, where each node represents a junction that has a weight associated with it. This weight indicates the time taken for water to propagate from this junction to its direct children. When the water tap at the root is turned on, water starts flowing through the tree towards the leaves.\nGiven such an n-ary tree, your task is to determine the minimum time required for water to reach all the leaf nodes starting from the root.\nFollow-up: Consider a more complex network where a junction can receive water from more than one parent, effectively turning the n-ary tree into a directed acyclic graph (DAG). How would you calculate the minimum time required for water to reach all the leaf nodes in this scenario?\nInput:\nroot: A TreeNode object representing the root of the n-ary tree for the initial problem or the DAG for the follow-up problem. Each TreeNode has the following properties:\nweight: An integer representing the time taken for water to propagate from this node to its children.\nchildren: A list of TreeNode objects representing the node's children. This list is non-empty for internal nodes and empty for leaf nodes.\nThe tree (or DAG in the follow-up) is guaranteed to have at least one leaf node.\nOutput:\nAn integer representing the minimum time required for water to reach all the leaves starting from the root.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n\n    8(root)\n   / \\\n  5   3\n /     \\\nleaf   leaf\n\nOutput: 13\n\nExplanation:\n- Starting at the root (8), the minimum time for water to reach the leaf through the left child is 8 (root) + 5 (internal node) = 13.\n- Through the right child, the time is 8 (root) + 3 = 11.\n- However, we are interested in the time it takes for all leaves to get water, which is determined by the slower path, thus the answer is 13.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n      8(root)\n     / \n    5\n   / \n  3\n /\nleaf   \n\nOutput: 16",

    "description": "Given a linked list that contains a loop (i.e., the last node points back to one of the previous nodes in the list instead of pointing to null), your task is to find the node where the loop starts. This node is referred to as the \"meeting point\". You are required to solve this problem using constant extra space.\nA linked list is said to contain a loop if there exists a node in the list such that we can reach the same node again by continuously following the next pointer. The loop's \"meeting point\" is the node from which we can traverse the loop and eventually come back to it.\nInput: head: The head node of the linked list, which is an instance of ListNode. The linked list has at least one node and contains a loop.\nOutput: Return the ListNode that represents the start of the loop, i.e., the \"meeting point\" in the linked list. If the linked list does not contain a loop, return None.\nExample 1\nInput:\n`1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 4` (the last node points back to the node with value `4` instead of pointing to `null`).\n\nOutput:\n4\n\nExplanation:\nIn the given linked list, the node with value `4` is the starting point of the loop. This is because starting from this node, we can follow the `next` pointers and eventually come back to the same node, thus forming a loop. Therefore, the node with value `4` is the \"meeting point\" of the loop in the linked list.",

    "description": "In an adventurous episode of the classic Tom and Jerry saga, Jerry has found himself trapped in the farthest corner of a massive house by Tom. The house is represented as an m x n grid, each cell symbolizing a different room. Tom, starting from the entrance in the top-left room, is determined to navigate through the house to catch Jerry, who is hiding in the bottom-right room.\nTom starts his pursuit with a certain number of energy points, a measure of his stamina. If at any point Tom's energy points deplete to 0 or below, he becomes too exhausted to continue the chase.\nThe rooms in the house are filled with various obstacles or boosts: some rooms have traps set by Jerry (indicated by negative integers, which drain Tom's energy upon entering), others are neutral (indicated as 0), and some contain snacks that increase Tom's energy (indicated by positive integers).\nDriven by his determination to catch Jerry as quickly as possible, Tom decides to move only rightward or downward through the house.\nYour task is to determine the minimum initial energy points Tom needs to ensure he can catch Jerry, considering the traps, neutral spaces, and energy boosts he may encounter from the very first room to the last.\nInput:\nhouse: A 2D list of integers where house[i][j] represents the condition of the room at row i and column j in the house. Negative integers represent rooms with traps, 0 represents neutral rooms, and positive integers represent rooms with energy-boosting snacks.\nOutput:\nReturn an integer representing the minimum initial energy points Tom requires to catch Jerry successfully.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nhouse = [\n    [-2, -3, 3],\n    [-5, -10, 1],\n    [10, 30, -5]\n]\n\nOutput:\n7\n\nExplanation:\nWith an initial energy of 7, Tom can follow the path: Right -> Right -> Down -> Down, ending the chase with at least 1 energy point left. This strategic path allows Tom to avoid the most severe traps while taking advantage of the snacks to maintain his energy, ensuring he catches Jerry in the end.",

    "description": "In the classic Dining Philosophers Problem, five philosophers sit at a round table with five forks (or chopsticks) placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can only take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available and they cannot start eating before getting both forks.\nEating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed. The problem is how to design a discipline of behavior (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.\nFunctional Requirements\nPhilosopher Actions: Each philosopher can perform one of three actions: think, try to pick up forks (both left and right), or eat. Philosophers must be able to pick up the forks and eat only when both their left and right forks are available.\nAvoid Deadlocks: Ensure that your solution prevents deadlock, where no philosopher can eat because each has picked up one fork and is waiting for the other.\nAvoid Starvation: Ensure that every philosopher eventually gets to eat. A solution where a philosopher could end up never eating (because of being continuously preempted by others) is not acceptable.\nConcurrency: Implement the solution in a multithreaded fashion, with each philosopher represented by a separate thread or process.\nTechnical Requirements\nLanguage: You can choose any programming language that supports multithreading and synchronization mechanisms (e.g., Java, C++, Python with threading).\nSynchronization Mechanisms: Utilize appropriate synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes, semaphores, or monitors to manage the access to forks.\nLogging: Implement logging to show the state of each philosopher (thinking, waiting for forks, eating) and the state of each fork (available, held by philosopher X).",

This situation is described using an array named transactions, where each element transactions[i] = [fromi, toi, amounti] represents a transaction indicating that the individual with ID fromi has given amounti dollars to the individual with ID toi. Your objective is to compute the minimum number of transactions necessary to settle all the debts across this group of individuals. A debt is considered settled when everyone has either received the money they are owed or paid back the money they owe, achieving a state where no one owes money to anyone else within the group.\nInput Format:\nList of transactions is give.\nEach transaction is represented as: [fromi, toi, amounti]\nExample 1:\nInput: transactions = [[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The given transactions indicate that person `0` owes $10 to person `1`, and person `2` owes $5 to person `0`. Both debts can be settled directly with the given transactions, resulting in a total of 2 transactions needed to settle all debts.\nExample 2:\nInput: transactions = [[0, 1, 5], [1, 2, 7], [2, 0, 5]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: After analyzing the transactions, we can see that debts can be settled by just one final transaction of $2 from 1 to 2, thus output is 1.\nConstraints\n1 <= transactions.length <= 8\ntransactions[i].length == 3\nEach amounti is a positive integer, representing the amount of money transacted.\nThe IDs fromi and toi represent the unique identifiers for each person involved in the transactions.",

If there are no previous counts, return 0 or a suitable default value.\nEfficiency:\nThe put and get operations should be optimized for time complexity.\nExample:\nput(\"apple\", 1, 5) -> Null (Store 5 as the count for \"apple\" at timestamp 1)\nput(\"apple\", 3, 2) -> Null (Update \"apple\" count to 2 at timestamp 3)\nget(\"apple\", 2) -> 5 (The most recent count for \"apple\" at or before timestamp 2 is 5)\nget(\"apple\", 3) -> 2 (The count for \"apple\" at timestamp 3 is 2)\nget(\"apple\", 4) -> 2 (The most recent count for \"apple\" at or before timestamp 4 is 2)\nConstraints:\nThe number of calls to put and get is at most 10^5.\n0 <= timestamp <= 10^9\n0 <= count <= 10^9\nAll key strings consist of lower-case English letters.",

    "description": "In a linear garden, sprinklers are positioned at every point along its length. Each sprinkler has a specific range denoted by its power p[i], allowing it to water the garden from position (i - p[i]) to (i + p[i]). Given an array p representing the power of each sprinkler along the garden (indexed from 0), your task is to calculate the minimum number of sprinklers required to completely water the entire garden. Assume the garden starts at position 0 and ends at the last sprinkler's position.\nExample 1:\nInput: p = [1, 2, 1]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The second sprinkler has a power of 2, covering the entire garden from 0 to 4. Thus, only 1 sprinkler is needed.\nExample 2:\nInput: p = [1, 0, 2, 2]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The third sprinkler covers from position 1 to 5, and the first sprinkler covers from 0 to 2. Therefore, the first and third sprinklers together can cover the entire garden, needing a minimum of 2 sprinklers.\nExample 3:\nInput: p = [0, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Since all sprinklers have a power of 0, they can only water their own position. If the garden length is more than 1, it's impossible to cover the entire garden, thus returning 0.\nConstraints\n1 <= p.length <= 10^4\n0 <= p[i] <= 100",

    "description": "In this problem, you are provided with a set of elements where each element is associated with a list of properties. Properties are considered duplicates if they have the same value and are located at the same index within their respective property list. Additionally, elements exhibit transitive relationships, meaning if element1 is related to element2 and element2 is related to element3, then element1 is also related to element3.\nYour task is to construct a dependency chain that outlines the connections between elements based on their matching/duplicate properties.\nExamples:\nExample 1:\nInput:\ne1 -> p1 p2 p3\ne2 -> p4 p5 p3\ne3 -> p1 p3 p6\n\nOutput: [e1, e2, e3]\n\nExplanation:\n  - `e1` and `e2` are connected because they share a property (`p3`) at the same index.\n  - `e1` and `e3` are indirectly connected through `e2`, as `e1` shares a property with `e2` (`p3`), and `e2` shares a property with `e3` (indirectly implied by the transitive relationship through `e1`).\n  - The dependency chain forms as `e1 -> e2 -> e3` due to the shared properties, resulting in a single chain: `[e1, e2, e3]`.\nExample 2:\nInput:\ne1 -> p1 p2\ne2 -> p3 p4\ne3 -> p1 p4\n\nOutput: \n[e1, e3]\n[e2]\n\nExplanation:\n  - `e1` and `e3` are connected because they share a property (`p1`) at the same index.\n  - `e2` does not share any properties with `e1` or `e3` at the same index, making it separate.\n  - Therefore, there are two chains: `[a1, a3]` and `[a2]`.",

    "description": "You are given an array named debris that contains integers representing pieces of space debris in a linear orbit. Each piece of debris's absolute value indicates its mass, while its sign indicates its direction of travel (a positive value means it is moving clockwise, and a negative value means it is moving counter-clockwise). All pieces of debris move at the same speed.\nYour task is to simulate the collisions between these pieces of debris and determine the state of the orbit after all collisions have occurred. The rules for collision are as follows:\nIf two pieces of debris meet (one moving clockwise and the other moving counter-clockwise), the smaller one will disintegrate. In case of a tie in mass, both will disintegrate.\nTwo pieces of debris moving in the same direction will never meet and, therefore, will not collide.\nImplement a function that takes the debris array as input and returns an array representing the state of the orbit after all collisions have been resolved.\nExample 1:\nInput: debris = [4, 9, -4]\nOutput: [4, 9]\nExplanation: The 9 and -4 pieces of debris will collide, with the -4 piece disintegrating because it is smaller. The 4 and 9 pieces are moving in the same direction, so they do not collide. The final state is [4, 9].\nExample 2:\nInput: debris = [5, -5]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: The 5 and -5 pieces of debris will collide, and since they are of equal mass, both will disintegrate. The final state is an empty array [].\nExample 3:\nInput: debris = [10, 2, -5]\nOutput: [10]\nExplanation: The 2 and -5 pieces of debris will collide, with the -5 piece disintegrating because it is smaller. The 10 piece is not affected and remains. The final state is [10].\nExample 4:\nInput: debris = [-2, -1, 1, 2]\nOutput: [-2, -1, 1, 2]\nExplanation: All pieces of debris are moving away from each other, so there are no collisions. The final state of the debris remains unchanged.",

    "description": "In Swift, optionals are a powerful feature that allows variables to either hold a value or be nil, indicating the absence of a value. This concept is crucial for handling situations where a value may or may not be present, thus avoiding runtime errors related to null references. However, imagine a scenario where the built-in optional type ? is not available due to framework constraints or for educational purposes, you are required to implement a similar functionality from scratch. Your task is to create a custom Optional type, named MyOptional, that mimics the behavior of Swift's native optional types.\nFunctional Requirements:\nGeneric Type: The MyOptional type should be generic, capable of holding any type of value.\nInitialization: It should be possible to initialize MyOptional with a value or as nil.\nUnwrapping: Implement a method to safely unwrap the value, returning a default value if the optional is none.\nOptional Chaining (Bonus): As a bonus challenge, implement a simplified form of optional chaining that allows methods and properties to be accessed on the optional's value directly from the MyOptional instance.\nExample Inputs & Outputs:\nInitialization\nInput: let myString: MyOptional<String> = MyOptional.some(\"Hello\")\nOutput: An instance of MyOptional holding the string \"Hello\".\nInput: let myNil: MyOptional<String> = MyOptional.none\nOutput: An instance of MyOptional representing none.\nUnwrapping\nInput: myString.unwrap(default: \"Default\")\nOutput: \"Hello\"\nInput: myNil.unwrap(default: \"Default\")\nOutput: \"Default\"\nTechnical Requirements:\nUse Swift as the programming language.\nMake sure your custom optional type is generic and can work with any data type.\nEnsure that your implementation is safe and follows Swift's error-handling and type-checking best practices.",

    "description": "The objective is to design and implement a system that not only performs various sorting operations on collections but also logs the steps, decisions, and outcomes of these operations. The challenge emphasizes adherence to low-level design principles, focusing on the SOLID principles and promoting clean, modular, and extensible code architecture. This system should be capable of sorting collections of integers through different algorithms and logging the process and results in a structured manner.\nFunctional Requirements:\nSorting Algorithms: Implement at least three distinct sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm should adhere to a common interface, allowing for interchangeability and flexibility in sorting strategy.\nLogging Mechanism: Develop a logging mechanism that can log messages with varying levels of importance (INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and to multiple outputs (e.g., console, file). The logging format should be standardized and include timestamps.\nSorting Logger: Integrate the logging mechanism with the sorting algorithms to log key events during the sorting process, such as initialization, comparisons, swaps, and completion. The logs should provide insights into the algorithm's behavior and performance.\nTechnical Requirements:\nLanguage and Frameworks: You are free to choose an object-oriented programming language like Java, Python, or C#. If using Java, consider interfaces and abstract classes; if Python, duck typing and abstract base classes can be utilized.\nSOLID Principles: Ensure your design strictly follows SOLID principles for OOP design.\nDesign Patterns: Apply appropriate design patterns, such as Strategy for sorting algorithms and Factory or Singleton for the logging mechanism.\nError Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage invalid inputs, unsupported operations, or failures during sorting or logging.\nExample Usage:\nA user selects the Quick Sort algorithm and starts the sorting process on an array of integers. They choose to log the process to both the console and a file with INFO level.\nThe system logs the start of the sorting process, each swap made, and the final sorted array, along with the total time taken to sort.",

    "description": "You are given an integer array nums. Your task is to find a subarray within this array that has the largest product of its elements. The subarray can be of any length, including just one element, and it must be contiguous (elements are directly adjacent to each other in the order they appear in nums). Return the largest product possible from these subarrays.\nThe test cases for this problem are designed such that the answer will always fit within a 32-bit integer, ensuring that you don't need to worry about exceptionally large numbers beyond the limit of a 32-bit integer storage.\nInput:\nAn integer array nums.\nOutput:\nAn integer representing the maximum product of a subarray within nums.\nConstraints:\n1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4\n-10 <= nums[i] <= 10\nThe product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [2,3,-2,4]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The subarray [2,3] has the largest product 6.\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [0, 2]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The contiguous subarray with the largest product is [2], as the product of 2 is greater than the product of 0.\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [-2, -3, -4]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: The contiguous subarray with the largest product is [-3, -4], with a product of -3 * -4 = 12. A negative times a negative equals a positive, and in this case, including all elements leads to the maximum product.\nExample 4:\nInput: nums = [-1, -2, -3, 0]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The contiguous subarray with the largest product is [-2, -3], with a product of -2 * -3 = 6. The presence of 0 in the array makes any subarray containing it have a product of 0, hence not the maximum.",

    "description": "Imagine you are working on an operating system's task manager, and you need to develop a simple yet efficient way to schedule jobs for the CPU to execute. The CPU can handle multiple jobs, but instead of using a Round Robin approach, you are tasked with implementing a priority-based job scheduling algorithm.\nIn this system, every job is assigned a priority value, and the CPU selects the job with the highest priority to execute next. If two jobs have the same priority, the job that arrived first (based on the submission time) should be chosen first.\nYour task is to design and implement this job scheduling system. You should be able to:\nAdd a new job to the system with a specified priority. The job can be represented by a simple ID and its priority level.\nExecute the next job: The system should be able to select and execute the job with the highest priority. After a job is executed, it is considered completed and removed from the scheduling queue.\nAssume the execution itself is instantaneous for the sake of simplicity (you don't need to simulate the actual execution time, just remove the job from the queue).\nRequirements:\nImplement a function to add a job to the queue, which takes a job ID and its priority.\nImplement a function to execute the next job, which selects the job with the highest priority that was added earliest among those with the same priority, and returns its ID.\nIf there are no jobs to execute, indicate somehow (for example, by returning null or a special value).\nExample:\nAdd job with ID \"Job1\" and priority 5.\nAdd job with ID \"Job2\" and priority 3.\nAdd job with ID \"Job3\" and priority 5.\nExecute the next job (should execute \"Job1\" because it has the highest priority and was added first).\nExecute the next job (should execute \"Job3\" because it is now the next highest priority job that was added first).\nAdditional Details:\nYou can assume the job ID is unique.\nThe priority is an integer where a higher number indicates a higher priority.",

This system should efficiently manage the booking of movie tickets in a multiplex cinema that has multiple screens, ensuring that no more tickets are sold than the available seats in each screening, even in the face of concurrent booking requests.\nThe primary challenge is to handle concurrent bookings in such a way that avoids race conditions, ensuring the integrity of the booking process. This includes preventing the sale of the same seat to multiple customers and accurately reflecting the current availability of seats.\nExample Scenario:\nThe system is initialized with a list of movies, each having multiple screenings throughout the day.

If there are at least 8 seats available, both bookings should succeed. If there are fewer than 8 seats available, one booking should succeed, and the other should be declined based on the system's concurrency handling logic.\nAfter the bookings are processed, the seat availability for the 7:00 PM screening of Movie X should reflect the updated number of booked seats.",

The number represents the count of the letters that are omitted in the abbreviation. For example, the abbreviation a2le for the word apple means that the letters pp (2 letters) are skipped.\nConsecutive skipped letters can only be represented by one number. For example, a10e is invalid for apple since there are not 10 characters between a and e.\nThe abbreviation cannot have leading zeros. For instance, a01 is invalid.\nThe letters in the abbreviation abbr appear in the same order as in word.\nExample 1:\nInput: word = \"internationalization\", abbr = \"i12iz4n\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation: The abbreviation \"i12iz4n\" can be expanded to \"internationalization\" which is the same as the word.\nExample 2:\nInput: word = \"apple\", abbr = \"a2le\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation: The abbreviation \"a2le\" skips the 2 letters \"pp\" in \"apple\".\nExample 3:\nInput: word = \"apple\", abbr = \"a10e\"\nOutput: False\nExplanation: \"a10e\" suggests that there are 10 letters skipped between 'a' and 'e', which is not the case for \"apple\".\nExample 4:\nInput: word = \"apple\", abbr = \"a01\"\nOutput: False\nExplanation: The abbreviation has a leading zero, which is not allowed.",

Your task is to write comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality and reliability of the escalator system under various conditions. The escalator system's software controls its operational states, responds to sensor inputs, and manages safety protocols.\nThe escalator system should support the following functionalities:\nStart/Stop Operations: The escalator can be started or stopped manually through a control panel and automatically by sensors detecting passengers.\nDirection Control: The escalator can move in two directions: up and down. The direction can be preset based on expected foot traffic or changed manually for special circumstances. -** Emergency Stop:** The system must support an immediate stop feature in case of emergencies, triggered either by a manual switch or automatically by sensors detecting a potential hazard (e.g., an obstruction on the escalator).\nMaintenance Mode: The escalator can be put into a maintenance mode, during which it should not be operational by users or sensors until maintenance is complete and the mode is manually turned off.",

    "description": "A company SuperBidder has hosted an Online Auction System where any user(seller) can sell an object through an auction. Each auction has a lowest bid limit and the highest bid limit. Any registered user(buyer) can participate in an auction and bid on the product. Buyers can update this bid amount or withdraw from an auction until the auction is completed. When the auction closes, show the winning bid using the highest unique bid.\n\nThe program should take as input two or more auctions and a set of users participating in these. Multiple auctions can happen simultaneously.\n\n###### Extension\nA new requirement came in where SuperBidder has requested that they want to decide the winner based on the lowest unique bid as well. Accommodate this change as well.\n\n###### For SDE 3s only\nBuyers have a limited total budget in the beginning. If the buyer wins the auction, his budget is reduced by the bid amount. Any new bid exceeding the bid amount should be rejected. Buyers should be able to increase the budget at any point as well.\n\n###### Highest Unique bid definition\n```\nFor a set of users A, B, C, D, E participating in auction A1\nA bids 50,\nB bids 90,\nC bids 100,\nD bids 90,\nE bids 70,\nF bids 100\nHere 70 is the highest unique bid, therefore E is the winner.\n```\nIf there is no highest unique bid by the end of the auction, there is no winner for the auction.\n\n###### Functional Requirements\n- Add buyer\n- Add seller\n- Create auction\n- Create/Update bid\n- Withdraw bid\n- Close auction and return winning bid and the winner name\n- Update budget (Only for SDE 3s)\n\n###### Bonus\n- Upgrade the buyer to a preferred buyer if he has participated in more than 2 auctions. And for choosing a winner, whenever there is a tie on the winning bid, preference should be given to the preferred buyer and if it’s tied between multiple preferred buyers, fallback to the next highest bid.\n- The preferred buyer is across sellers on the platform.\n\n###### Sample Test Cases\nTest Case 1:\n```\nADD_BUYER(“buyer1”)\nADD_BUYER(“buyer2”)\nADD_BUYER(“buyer3”)\nADD_SELLER(“seller1”)\nCREATE_AUCTION(“A1”, “10”, “50”,  “seller1”)\nCREATE_BID(“buyer1”, “A1”, “17”)\nCREATE_BID(“buyer2”, “A1”, “15”)\nUPDATE_BID(“buyer2”, “A1”, “19”)\nCREATE_BID(“buyer3”, “A1”, “19”)\nCLOSE_AUCTION(“A1”) // Should give Buyer1 as winner\n```\n\nTest Case 2\n```\nADD_SELLER(“seller2”)\nCREATE_AUCTION(“A2”, “5”, “20”, “seller2”)\nCREATE_BID(“buyer3”, ”A2”, 25) //This should fail as highest bid limit is 20 for A2\nCREATE_BID(“buyer2, ”A2”, 5)\nWITHDRAW_BID(“buyer2”, “A2”)\nCLOSE_AUCTION(“A2”) // No winner\n```\n\nTest Case 3 (With budget constraint)\n```\nADD_BUYER(“buyer1”, 20)\nADD_BUYER(“buyer2”, 20)\nADD_BUYER(“buyer3”, 20)\nADD_SELLER(“seller1”)\nADD_SELLER(“seller2”)\nCREATE_AUCTION(“A1”, “10”, “50”, “seller1”)\nCREATE_AUCTION(“A2”, “5”, “20”, “seller2”)\nCREATE_BID(“buyer1”, “A1”, “17”)\nCREATE_BID(“buyer2”, “A1”, “15”)\nUPDATE_BID(“buyer2”, “A1”, “19”)\nCREATE_BID(“buyer3”, “A1”, “19”)\nCLOSE_AUCTION(“A1”) // Should give Buyer1 as winner\nCREATE_BID(“buyer1, ”A1”, 5) //This should fail as budget exceeds for buyer1\nCREATE_BID(“buyer3”, ”A2”, 25) //This should fail as highest bid limit is 20 for A2\nCREATE_BID(“buyer2, ”A2”, 5)\nWITHDRAW_BID(“buyer2”, “A2”)\nCLOSE_AUCTION(“A2”) // No winner\n```\n\n###### Expectations and Guidelines\n1. Create the sample data yourself. You can put it into a file, test case or main driver program itself.\n2. The code should be demo-able. Either by using the main driver program or test cases.\n3. The code should be modular. The code should have the basic OO design. Please do not jam in the responsibilities of one class into another.\n4. The code should be extensible. Wherever applicable, use interfaces and contracts between different methods. It should be easy to add/remove functionality without rewriting the entire codebase.\n5. The code should handle edge cases properly and fail gracefully.\n6. The code should be legible, readable and DRY.\n7. Database integration is not required.\n8. Please do not access the internet for anything EXCEPT syntax.\n9. You are free to use the language and IDE of your choice.\n10. The entire code should be your own.\n\t\n###### Sample Input Used\n```\n\tADD_SELLER SHUBHAM\n\tADD_SELLER AKASH\n\tCREATE_AUCTION BISCUITS 10 25 SHUBHAM\n\tCREATE_AUCTION NAMKEEN 10 25 SHUBHAM\n\tCREATE_AUCTION DARU 10 25 SHUBHAM\n\tCREATE_AUCTION BEER 10 25 SHUBHAM\n\t\n\tADD_BUYER RACHIT\n\tADD_BUYER AMIT \n\tADD_BUYER ARNAV \n\t\n\t\n\tCREATE_BID RACHIT BISCUITS 15\n\tCREATE_BID RACHIT DARU 15\n\t\n\tCREATE_BID AMIT BEER 15\n\tCREATE_BID ARNAV BEER 15\n\t\n\tCREATE_BID ARNAV NAMKEEN 14\n\t\n\t UPDATE_BID AMIT BISCUITS 19\n\t\n\tWITHDRAW_BID RACHIT BISCUITS\n\t\n\tCLOSE_AUCTION BISCUITS\n\tCLOSE_AUCTION NAMKEEN\n\t\n\tCLOSE_AUCTION DARU\n\tCLOSE_AUCTION BEER\n```\t\n Whatever kind of mentorship session you need.

    "description": "Due to the wide range of payment players available, organizations often integrate multiple payment gateways and dynamically switch between them to suit their use cases. Based on customer preferences, payments can be made through:\n- Cards (credit or debit)\n- UPI (Virtual Payment Address)\n- Net banking\n\n**General Payment Process:**\n- Select a Payment Mode\n- Enter Payment Details:\n  - Net Banking: Enter username and password.\n  - Credit/Debit Card: Enter card details (card number, expiry date, CVV, etc.).\n  - UPI: Enter the VPA (Virtual Payment Address).\n\n\n**Payment Gateway Design**\nThis section outlines the design of a Payment Gateway (PG) that facilitates payments for its clients. The design should consider the following requirements and assumptions.\n\n**Feature Requirements:**\n- **Multiple Clients Support:** The PG should allow multiple clients to onboard and use the system.\n- **Bank Integrations:** The PG must support integration with multiple banks, e.g., HDFC, ICICI, SBI. \n- **Payment Methods:** The PG should support the following payment methods:\n  - UPI\n  - Credit/Debit Cards\n  - Net Banking\n\n**Payment Traffic Router: ** The PG must include a router that directs transactions to specific banks based on the payment method:\nE.g., All credit card transactions go to HDFC, while net banking transactions are sent to ICICI. \n\n**Traffic Distribution:** The PG should have the ability to allocate specific percentages of traffic to different banks. For instance: \n- Bank 1 handles 30% of the traffic. \n- Bank 2 handles 70% of the traffic. \n\n**Assumptions:**\n- **Bank Response Simulation:** Each bank can return either success or failure randomly. A function should be created to simulate this behavior.\n- **Required Payment Details:** Payments should only be processed if the necessary parameters for the chosen payment method are provided. For example:\n  - Net banking requires a username and password.\n  - Credit cards require card details (number, expiry date, and CVV).\n- **OTP Verification:** Although OTP verification is usually required after payment details are provided, for simplicity, transactions will proceed without OTP verification.\n\n**Code Expectations:**\n- The implementation should be in-memory.\n- Simple and basic functions should be created as entry points; no marks will be awarded for implementing a RESTful API or a complete framework.\n\n**Required Functions:**\n1. showDistribution(): This function should display the current distribution percentage of payment traffic across the integrated banks.\n2. makePayment(): This function should process a payment based on the provided payment details. Different methods (e.g., UPI, cards, net banking) should be handled accordingly.\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n- The code should be working and functionally correct.\n- The code should be modular, readable, and follow appropriate abstractions.\n- The design should be extensible for future requirements.\n- The code should include unit tests.\n- Candidates should demonstrate proficiency with their development environment, including their IDE, version control, and terminal usage.\n- Candidates should demonstrate effective use of language constructs to solve the problem.\n- Candidates should have strong debugging skills.\n Whatever kind of mentorship session you need.

The system needs to track the frequency of each price as new orders close and should be capable of dynamically adjusting the data as prices become outdated and need removal.\nFunctionalities:\nYour system should support the following functionalities:\nadd(price: double): This function takes a double representing the price of a recently closed order and adds it to your tracking system.\nremoveOldestPrice(): This function removes the oldest price that was added to the tracking system.\nmode() -> double: This function returns the price that has appeared most frequently in the tracking system.\nExample:\npriceAnalyzer.add(200.0);\npriceAnalyzer.add(150.0);\npriceAnalyzer.add(200.0);\npriceAnalyzer.mode(); // Returns 200.0, as it is the most frequent price.\n\npriceAnalyzer.add(150.0);\npriceAnalyzer.mode(); // Still returns 200.0.\n\npriceAnalyzer.removeOldestPrice(); // Removes the first occurrence of 200.0.\npriceAnalyzer.mode(); // Returns 150.0, as now 150.0 and 200.0 both appear with the same frequency, but 150.0 is the oldest.\nConstraints:\nPrices are considered with precision up to two decimal places.\nThe number of operations (add and remove) will not exceed 10^6.\nEnsure your implementation handles concurrent calls to add, removeOldestPrice, and mode effectively.",

    "description": "You are asked to design and implement a thread pool library that manages execution of multiple jobs using a fixed number of worker threads. The goal is to ensure that incoming jobs are executed efficiently without creating a new thread for every request.\nYour design should meet the following requirements:\nThread Pool Initialization\nThe thread pool should be initialized with a fixed number of worker threads (configurable during creation).\nAll worker threads should remain alive and ready to take jobs until the pool is shut down.\nJob Submission\nA client should be able to submit jobs (units of work) to the thread pool.\nEach job will be represented as a function/task that needs to be executed.\nJobs may come in faster than they can be executed, so there must be a way to hold them in a queue until a thread is free.\nJob Execution\nIdle worker threads should pick jobs from the queue and execute them.\nMultiple jobs may be submitted concurrently from different client threads.\nNo job should be lost; all submitted jobs must eventually run.\nThread Safety\nThe design must handle synchronization properly so that jobs are not missed or executed multiple times.\nMultiple clients submitting jobs at the same time should not cause corruption in the queue.\nShutdown Mechanism\nThe library should support a graceful shutdown.\nAfter shutdown is initiated, no new jobs should be accepted, but already submitted jobs should still complete.\nWorker threads should exit cleanly once all jobs are processed.\nAdditional Considerations\nIf the job queue is empty, worker threads should wait without consuming CPU unnecessarily.\nIf the queue has jobs but all threads are busy, the new jobs should wait in the queue until a worker becomes available.\nExample Scenario:\nInitialize a thread pool with 4 threads.\nSubmit 10 jobs where each job prints its ID and simulates work by sleeping for 2 seconds.\nObserve that at most 4 jobs are processed at the same time, and the rest wait until a thread is free.",

In this scenario, a rook can move to another position and capture a rook on that position, removing it from the chessboard. The goal is to minimize the number of rooks such that no rooks can attack each other directly in a final stable configuration. The initial positions of the K rooks are provided as input, and rooks can make any number of moves.\nExample 1:\nInput: N = 4, K = 3, Positions = [(0,0), (1,1), (3,3)]\nOutput: 1\n\nExplanation: One possible sequence of moves could be:\n- Rook at (1,1) moves to (0,0) and captures the rook. Remaining positions: [(1,1), (3,3)]\n- Rook at (3,3) moves to (1,1) and captures the rook. Final positions: [(3,3)]\nThus, only 1 rook remains.\nExample 2:\nInput: N = 4, K = 4, Positions = [(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (3,3)]\nOutput: 2\n\nExplanation: One possible sequence of moves could be:\n- Rook at (0,1) moves to (0,0) and captures the rook. Remaining positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (3,3)]\n- Rook at (1,0) moves to (0,1) and captures the rook. Final positions: [(1,0), (3,3)]\nThus, 2 rooks remain, each unable to attack the other.",

    "description": "You are given an array that represents a row of seats, where seats[i] = 1 indicates that a person is sitting in the i-th seat, and seats[i] = 0 indicates that the i-th seat is empty. There is at least one empty seat and at least one person sitting in the row. Your task is to find the seat for a person named Alex such that the distance to the nearest person seated is maximized. Return this maximum possible distance.\nExample 1:\nInput: seats = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: If Alex sits in the third seat (index 2), the closest person is 2 seats away. This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 2.\nExample 2:\nInput: seats = [1, 0, 0, 0]\nOutput: 3\n\nExplanation: The last seat (index 3) is the best place for Alex to sit as it is the furthest from the closest person, who is 3 seats away at index 0.\nExample 3:\nInput: seats = [0, 1]\nOutput: 1\n\nExplanation: The best seat is at the beginning of the row (index 0) as it is 1 seat away from the nearest person seated at index 1.",

    "description": "Design a data structure called a Versioned Stack that supports the following operations efficiently:\npush(e): Pushes an element e onto the stack. This operation should complete in O(1) time complexity.\npop(): Removes the element on top of the stack. This operation should also have a time complexity of O(1).\nprint(version): Outputs all elements present in the stack at a specified version. This operation may take O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in that version.\nEach push or pop operation creates a new version of the stack. For instance, performing a push operation on an empty stack creates version 1, another push creates version 2, and a subsequent pop would then create version 3.\nExample 1:\nOperations: push(5), push(6), pop()\nOutput for print(1): [5]\nOutput for print(2): [5, 6]\nOutput for print(3): [5]\n\nExplanation:\n- After push(5), the stack at version 1 is [5].\n- After push(6), the stack at version 2 is [5, 6].\n- After pop(), the top element (6) is removed, leaving the stack at version 3 as [5].\nExample 2:\nOperations: push(10), push(20), push(30), pop(), push(40)\nOutput for print(1): [10]\nOutput for print(2): [10, 20]\nOutput for print(3): [10, 20, 30]\nOutput for print(4): [10, 20]\nOutput for print(5): [10, 20, 40]\n\nExplanation:\n- Initial pushes populate the stack up to version 3.\n- A pop operation removes the top element (30), creating version 4.\n- A push operation adds 40 to the stack, creating version 5.",

The function should handle decimal precision meticulously, as the input parameters and output can vary significantly in their decimal places.

The function should return the decoded version of the string.\nThe input string is valid, with no extra whitespaces and correctly formed brackets. Note that digits in the string are only used to indicate the number of times the strings within the brackets should be repeated, and they do not appear in the original unencoded string segments.

Together they form \"pppqrqr\".\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"2[p4[q]]\"\nOutput: \"pqqqqpqqqq\"",

    "description": "Design a data structure that combines the functionality of a map and list, allowing for efficient key-value mapping as well as retrieval of the nth inserted key-value pair. The data structure should support the following operations:\nadd(key, value): Adds a new key-value pair to the structure. If the key already exists, update its value.\ngetByKey(key): Retrieves the value associated with the given key.\ngetByIndex(index): Retrieves the nth key-value pair added to the map, based on insertion order.\nThis structure should optimize for both key-based access and order-based access of elements, making it suitable for scenarios where both types of access are frequently needed.\nExample 1:\nInput\nadd(\"apple\", 10), add(\"banana\", 20), getByKey(\"apple\"), getByIndex(1)\n\nOutput\n10, (\"banana\", 20)\n\nExplanation\n\"apple\" maps to 10. The first element added was \"apple\", and the second was \"banana\". getByIndex(1) returns \"banana\" and its value 20.\nExample 2:\nInput\nadd(\"cat\", 30), add(\"dog\", 40), add(\"cat\", 50), getByKey(\"cat\"), getByIndex(0)\nOutput\n50, (\"cat\", 50)\nExplanation\nInitially, \"cat\" maps to 30, but it is updated to 50. \"cat\" is the first element added, so getByIndex(0) returns \"cat\" and its updated value 50.",

If an IP address does not fall into any of the defined buckets or is not a valid IP address, the function should return -1 for that IP address.\nThe IP address ranges for the buckets are as follows:\nBucket 0: 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255\nBucket 1: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255\nBucket 2: 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255\nBucket 3: 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255\nBucket 4: 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255\nExample 1:\nInput: [\"192.168.1.1\", \"256.1.1.1\"]\nOutput: [2, -1]\nExplanation: \"192.168.1.1\" falls into the third bucket (Bucket 2), while \"256.1.1.1\" is not a valid IP address.\nExample 2:\nInput: [\"127.0.0.1\", \"128.0.0.1\", \"190.255.255.255\"]\nOutput: [0, 1, 1]\nExplanation: \"127.0.0.1\" falls into the first bucket (Bucket 0), \"128.0.0.1\" and \"190.255.255.255\" fall into the second bucket (Bucket 1).",

    "description": "Given an array task_memory, representing the memory requirements for each task, and another array task_type, representing the type of each task, along with an integer max_memory which is the maximum memory the server can use to process two tasks concurrently, your function should calculate the minimum amount of time required to process all tasks. Each task requires 1 unit of time to process. The server can process two tasks at the same time only if:\nThey are of the same type.\nTheir combined memory usage does not exceed max_memory.\nExample 1:\nInput: n = 4, task_memory = [7, 2, 3, 9], task_type = [1, 2, 1, 3], max_memory = 10\nOutput: 3\n\nExplanation:\n- Tasks 0 (type 1, memory 7) and 2 (type 1, memory 3) can be processed together in 1 unit of time because their combined memory (10) matches the max_memory limit.\n- Task 1 (type 2, memory 2) and Task 3 (type 3, memory 9) must be processed separately, taking 1 unit of time each due to differing types and exceeding memory constraints.\nThus, the total time required is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 units.",

    "description": "Given an unsorted array nums of integers, you are required to find and return the smallest positive integer that is missing from the array. The solution should run in O(n) time complexity and use only O(1) auxiliary space (excluding the input and output variables).\nThe integers in the array could include both positive and negative numbers, and the array size can vary considerably. It's important to implement a solution that efficiently scans and identifies gaps in the sequence of positive integers represented in the array.\nConstraints:\nThe length of the array nums is at least 1 and could be very large.\nThe integers in nums could be both negative and positive, and their magnitude could be up to 2^31 - 1.\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [3, 4, -1, 1]\nOutput: 2\n\nExplanation: \nThe array contains the positive integers 3, 4, and 1. The smallest missing positive integer is 2.\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [1, 2, 0]\nOutput: 3\n\nExplanation:\nThe array contains the positive integers 1 and 2. The smallest missing positive integer is 3.\nExample 3:\nInput: nums = [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]\nOutput: 1\n\nExplanation:\nThere are no numbers between 1 and 6, so the smallest missing positive integer is 1.",

The application should allow users to perform the following core operations:\nAdd a new To-Do item: Users should be able to type a task into an input field and add it to the list. New items should initially be marked as incomplete.\nToggle completion status: Users should be able to mark a To-Do item as complete or incomplete (e.g., by clicking on it or a checkbox).\nDelete a To-Do item: Users should be able to remove an item from the list.\nDisplay To-Do items: All active and completed items should be visible in the list.\nThe application should maintain its state (the list of To-Do items) within the React component hierarchy. Focus on clear component structure, efficient state management, and a basic user experience.\nInput Format:\nThe primary input for this application will be user interactions, such as typing text into an input field and clicking buttons or checkboxes. Assume the application starts with an empty list of To-Do items.\nOutput Format:\nThe rendered React component should display:\nAn input field for adding new tasks.\nA button to submit new tasks.\nA list of current To-Do items. Each item in the list should clearly show its text and completion status, along with an interactive element (e.g., checkbox or button) to toggle its status and a button to delete it.\nExample 1:\nInitial State:\nNo tasks displayed. Input field for new tasks is empty.\n\nUser Action: Types \"Buy groceries\" into the input field and clicks the \"Add\" button.\nExpected UI:\n- The input field becomes empty.\n- The list displays:\n  - [ ] Buy groceries (with a delete button)\n\nUser Action: Types \"Read a book\" into the input field and clicks the \"Add\" button.\nExpected UI:\n- The input field becomes empty.\n- The list displays:\n  - [ ] Buy groceries (with a delete button)\n  - [ ] Read a book (with a delete button)\n\nUser Action: Clicks the checkbox next to \"Buy groceries\".\nExpected UI:\n- The list displays:\n  - [x] Buy groceries (with a delete button)\n  - [ ] Read a book (with a delete button)\n\nUser Action: Clicks the delete button next to \"Read a book\".\nExpected UI:\n- The list displays:\n  - [x] Buy groceries (with a delete button)\nConstraints:\nYou must use React functional components and hooks for state management.\nAvoid external state management libraries (e.g., Redux, Zustand) unless explicitly allowed by the interviewer.\nFocus on core functionality; extensive styling is not required.\nEach To-Do item should have a unique identifier.",

    "description": "Given a stream of integers and a fixed window size k, your task is to calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window. The sliding window moves forward by one position each time a new integer from the stream is added. The moving average should be calculated as the sum of the last k integers divided by k. If there are fewer than k integers available, the average should be calculated over the available numbers.\nYou need to implement a class MovingAverage with the following methods:\nMovingAverage(int size): Initializes the object with the size of the window k.\ndouble next(int val): Returns the moving average of the last k values after inserting the new integer val.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nMovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);\nm.next(1) -> 1.0\nExplanation: The window size is 3. The first number is 1, so the moving average is 1.0.\n\nm.next(10) -> 5.5\nExplanation: The window contains [1, 10]. The moving average is (1 + 10) / 2 = 5.5.\n\nm.next(3) -> 4.66667\nExplanation: The window contains [1, 10, 3]. The moving average is (1 + 10 + 3) / 3 = 4.66667.\n\nm.next(5) -> 6.0\nExplanation: The window slides forward. The new window contains [10, 3, 5].

    "description": "Given a 2D matrix matrix of integers, you need to efficiently handle multiple queries where you are asked to calculate the sum of the elements in a rectangular submatrix. The submatrix is defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and its lower right corner (row2, col2).\nYou are required to implement the NumMatrix class with the following methods:\nNumMatrix(int[][] matrix): Initializes the NumMatrix object with the given integer matrix.\nint sumRegion(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2): Returns the sum of the elements of the submatrix defined by (row1, col1) as the upper left corner and (row2, col2) as the lower right corner.\nThe sumRegion method should have an average time complexity of O(1).\nExample 1:\nInput:\nmatrix = [\n  [3, 0, 1, 4, 2],\n  [5, 6, 3, 2, 1],\n  [1, 2, 0, 1, 5],\n  [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],\n  [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]\n]\nNumMatrix numMatrix = new NumMatrix(matrix);\nnumMatrix.sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3); // Output: 8\nnumMatrix.sumRegion(1, 1, 2, 2); // Output: 11\nnumMatrix.sumRegion(1, 2, 2, 4); // Output: 12\n\nExplanation:\n- The sum of the submatrix from (2, 1) to (4, 3) is 8.\n- The sum of the submatrix from (1, 1) to (2, 2) is 11.\n- The sum of the submatrix from (1, 2) to (2, 4) is 12.\nExample 2:\nInput:\nmatrix = [\n  [-1]\n]\nNumMatrix numMatrix = new NumMatrix(matrix);\nnumMatrix.sumRegion(0, 0, 0, 0); // Output: -1\n\nExplanation:\n- The sum of the submatrix from (0, 0) to (0, 0) is -1.",

The same number may be chosen from the candidates array an unlimited number of times. You may return the combinations in any order.\nEach combination is unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.\nThe test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum to target is less than 150 combinations.\nExample 1:\nInput: candidates = [2, 3, 6, 7], target = 7\nOutput: [[2, 2, 3], [7]]\nExplanation:\n- 2 + 2 + 3 = 7.

    "description": "PhonePe processes a vast number of transactions every day, wherein some transactions may fail (enter a FAILED state) or remain in a PENDING state due to various reasons such as bank or NPCI issues, or internal PhonePe errors. To handle such cases efficiently, a resolution system is needed, where customers can log their unsuccessful transactions and raise complaints against them. The system must categorize customer issues into several types, such as payment-related, mutual fund-related, gold-related, or insurance-related. Different customer service agents will have their specific expertise based on the issue type, whom the system will assign the issues by marking them waiting in case all agents are busy. The customer service agents can work on one issue at a time and update its status, and once it is resolved, the agent will receive another issue.\nThe solution should incorporate the following features:\nCustomers can log a complaint against any unsuccessful transaction.\nCustomer Service Agents can search for customer issues with issue ID or customer details (email).\nAgents can view their assigned issues and mark them resolved once they are resolved.\nSystem should assign the issue to agents based on an assigning strategy.\nSystem should allow the admin to onboard new agents.\nSystem should allow the admin to view the agent's work history.\nImplementation requirements\nYour solution should implement the following functions. Feel free to use the representation for objects you deem fit for the problem and the provided use cases. The functions are ordered in the decreasing order of importance (highest to lowest). We understand that you may not be able to complete the implementation for all the functions listed here. So try to implement them in the order in which they are declared down below.\ncreateIssue(transactionId, issueType, subject, description, email)\naddAgent(agentEmail, agentName ,List<issueType>)\nassignIssue(issueId) // -> Issue can be assigned to the agents based on different strategies. For now, assign to any one of the free agents.\ngetIssues(filter) // -> issues against the provided filter\nupdateIssue(issueId, status, resolution)\nresolveIssue(issueId, resolution)\nviewAgentsWorkHistory() // -> a list of issue which agents worked on\nExample:\ncreateIssue(\"T1\", \"Payment Related\", \"Payment Failed\", \"My payment failed but money is debited\", \"testUser1@test.com\");\n>>> Issue I1 created against transaction \"T1\"\n\ncreateIssue(\"T2\", \"Mutual Fund Related\", \"Purchase Failed\", \"Unable to purchase Mutual Fund\", \"testUser2@test.com\");\n>>> Issue I2 created against transaction \"T2\"\n\ncreateIssue(\"T3\", \"Payment Related\", \"Payment Failed\", \"My payment failed but money is debited\", \"testUser2@test.com\");\n>>> Issue I3 created against transaction \"T3\"\n\n\naddAgent(\"agent1@test.com\", \"Agent 1\", Arrays.asList(\"Payment Related\", \"Gold Related\"));\n>>> Agent A1 created\n\naddAgent(\"agent2@test.com\", \"Agent 2\", Arrays.asList(\"Payment Related\"));\n>>> Agent A2 created\n\n\nassignIssue(\"I1\")\n>>> Issue I1 assigned to agent A1\n\nassignIssue(\"I2\")\n>>> Issue I2 assigned to agent A2\n\nassignIssue(\"I3\")\n>>> Issue I3 added to waitlist of Agent A1\n\n\ngetIssue({\"email\": \"testUser2@test.com\"});\n>>> I2 {\"T2\", \"Mutual Fund Related\", \"Purchase Failed\", \"Unable to purchase Mutual Fund\", \"testUser2@test.com\", \"Open\"},\n I3 {\"T3\", \"Payment Related\", \"Payment Failed\", \"My payment failed but money is debited\", , \"testUser2@test.com\", \"Open\"}\n\ngetIssue({\"type\": \"Payment Related\"});\n>>> I1{\"T1\", \"Payment Related\", \"Payment Failed\", \"My payment failed but money is debited\", \"testUser1@test.com\", \"Open\"},\n I3 {\"T3\", \"Payment Related\", \"Payment Failed\", \"My payment failed but money is debited\", \"testUser1@test.com\", \"Open\"}\n\n\nupdateIssue(\"I3\", \"In Progress\", \"Waiting for payment confirmation\");\n>>> I3 status updated to In Progress\n\n\nresolveIssue(\"I3\", \"PaymentFailed debited amount will get reversed\");\n>>> I3 issue marked resolved\n\n\nviewAgentsWorkHistory()\n>>> A1 -> {I1, I3}, \n    A2 -> {I2}",

Each board is of size 10x10.\nEach person can place 5 ships on his board\nCarrier of length 5\nBattleship of length 4\nCruiser of length 3\nSubmarine of length 3\nDestroyer of length 2\nPlayers take a turn to fire missiles at the opposing player. If the missile hits a ship, then the opposing player informs the initial mover of a hit, else he says it’s a miss. If all the spots on a ship are hit, then ship is sunk.\nThe first player to sink all 5 ships of the opposing player wins the game.\nThis is the view of one player\nLeft-hand side is the ships as placed by the player. Red spots represent where the enemy successfully struck the player’s ships.\nWhite/Green spots are where the enemy player missed.\nThe right-hand side is where the player has launched missiles against the enemy.\nThe player has sunk 3 of the enemy ship.\nBonus Requirement:\nYou don’t need to code this up, but explain how will you extend your design to allow people to play over the network (p2p without having a central server).\nGuidelines\nWe will be looking for the Low-Level Design including good class structure, entities and how they interact, good abstraction, good separation of concerns, etc\nYou will need to code the “Game Loop”.\nYou don’t need to bother with the code that “draws” the game or UI interactions, you can mock the function for eg. “drawBoard(List<Ship> ships)” and assume it draws the board with the ships on it. You can also assume a “takeInput(Player player)” function that gets the play that the current player wishes to make.\nBonus: Take the input from the console. For eg. player can say “Fire C5” and you fire a missile at C5 or “Draw Board” and you print the current state of the board to the player.\nYou can choose any language, however, it needs to be a runnable code.\nAssumptions\nPlease make the required assumptions, for instance, players can only join before the game starts, but MAKE SURE YOU LIST THEM IN A README FILE along with the code.",

Then, we can input overs ball by ball with the runs scored on that ball (could be wide, no ball or a wicket as well).\nYou are expected to print individual scores, number of balls faced, number of 4s, number of 6s for all the players from the batting side at the end of every over. You also need to print total score, total wickets. Essentially, you need to keep a track of all the players, strike changes (at the end of the over or after taking singles or 3s) and maintain their scores, also keep track of extra bowls that are being bowled (like wides or no balls). You also need to print which team won the match at the end.\nThis is the bare minimum solution which is expected for the problem. You can add some more features once you are done with these, like maintaining a bowlers record (total overs bowled, runs conceded, wickets taken, maiden overs, dot balls, economy, etc.). Total team extras, batsman strike rates, etc. can be added too. But these are \"good to have\" features, please try to complete the bare minimum first.\nMake sure your code is readable and maintainable and preferably object oriented.

    "description": "Design a cricket scorecard that will show the score for a team along with score of each player.\nYou will be given the number of players in each team, the number of overs and their batting order as input. Then, we can input overs ball by ball with the runs scored on that ball (could be wide, no ball or a wicket as well).\nYou are expected to print individual scores, number of balls faced, number of 4s, number of 6s for all the players from the batting side at the end of every over. You also need to print total score, total wickets. Essentially, you need to keep a track of all the players, strike changes (at the end of the over or after taking singles or 3s) and maintain their scores, also keep track of extra bowls that are being bowled (like wides or no balls). You also need to print which team won the match at the end.\nThis is the bare minimum solution which is expected for the problem. You can add some more features once you are done with these, like maintaining a bowlers record (total overs bowled, runs conceded, wickets taken, maiden overs, dot balls, economy, etc.). Total team extras, batsman strike rates, etc. can be added too. But these are \"good to have\" features, please try to complete the bare minimum first.\nMake sure your code is readable and maintainable and preferably object oriented. It should be modular and extensible, to add new features if needed.\nSample input and output:\nNo. of players for each team: 5\nNo. of overs: 2\nBatting Order for team 1:\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nP5\nOver 1:\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\n\nScorecard for Team 1:\nPlayer Name Score 4s 6s Balls\nP1* 3 0 0 3\nP2* 4 0 0 3\nP3 0 0 0 0\nP4 0 0 0 0\nP5 0 0 0 0\nTotal: 7/0\nOvers: 1\n\n\nOver 2:\nW\n4\n4\nWd\nW\n1\n6\n\n\nScorecard for Team 1:\nPlayer Name Score 4s 6s Balls\nP1 3 0 0 4\nP2* 10 0 1 4\nP3 8 2 0 3\nP4* 1 0 0 1\nP5 0 0 0 0\nTotal: 23/2\nOvers: 2\n\n\nBatting Order for team 2:\nP6\nP7\nP8\nP9\nP10\n\n\nOver 1:\n4\n6\nW\nW\n1\n1\n\n\nScorecard for Team 2:\nPlayer Name Score 4s 6s Balls\nP6 10 1 1 3\nP7* 1 0 0 1\nP8 0 0 0 1\nP9* 1 0 0 1\nP10 0 0 0 0\nTotal: 12/1\nOvers: 1\n\n\nOver 2:\n6\n1\nW\nW\n\n\nScorecard for Team 2:\nPlayer Name Score 4s 6s Balls\nP6 10 1 1 2\nP7* 8 0 1 3\nP8 0 0 0 1\nP9 1 0 0 2\nP10 0 0 0 1\nTotal: 19/4\nOvers: 1.4\n\n\nResult: Team 1 won the match by 4 runs",

There are two types of threads, oxygen and hydrogen, and the goal is to ensure that threads bond together in the correct ratio to form water molecules.\nEach thread type is provided with a specific method:\nOxygen threads call releaseOxygen().\nHydrogen threads call releaseHydrogen().\nThese threads interact with a barrier where they must wait until enough threads are present to form a complete water molecule. The synchronization must ensure the following:\nThread Grouping:\nEach group must consist of one oxygen thread and two hydrogen threads.\nNo thread may proceed until all three required threads for a water molecule are available.\nExecution Order:\nThreads forming one molecule must complete their execution and bond before any threads from the next molecule are allowed to proceed.\nFairness:\nThreads should not be starved; all waiting threads must eventually contribute to forming a molecule.\nBehavior Rules:\nIf an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier but fewer than two hydrogen threads are present, it must wait.\nIf a hydrogen thread arrives but there is no oxygen thread or a second hydrogen thread, it must wait.\nThreads do not need to explicitly pair with specific counterparts. Instead, the system should simply ensure that every group of three consists of one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.\nOutput Requirement:\nEach time a complete molecule is formed, the releaseOxygen and releaseHydrogen methods should execute in a way that corresponds to the formation of the molecule, maintaining the 2:1 ratio.",

The system should implement the following interface:\nclass WorkerInterface {\n    public void submitWork(); // Accepts a Task and returns immediately\n    public void blockUntilComplete(); // Blocks the calling thread until all submitted tasks are finished\n}\nRequirements\nCore Functionalities:\nTask Submission: The submitWork method should allow tasks to be added for execution. The method must return immediately without waiting for the task to complete.\nTask Completion Synchronization: The blockUntilComplete method should block the calling thread until all previously submitted tasks are fully executed.\nConcurrency:\nMultiple tasks should be executed concurrently using a thread pool.\nEnsure thread-safe handling of task submission and synchronization.\nModifications Allowed:\nYou are allowed to modify the method signatures to include necessary parameters (e.g., task details or callback mechanisms).\nInternal design changes, including the use of data structures or concurrency primitives, are permitted.\nPerformance Considerations:\nMinimize overhead during task submission and ensure efficient utilization of threads.\nAvoid unnecessary blocking or resource contention.\nEdge Cases:\nHandling scenarios where blockUntilComplete is called with no tasks submitted.\nEnsure correct behavior if submitWork is called while the client thread is blocked on blockUntilComplete.\nSupport graceful shutdown of the system after all tasks are processed.\nExample API Usage\nTask Submission:\nWorkerInterface worker = new WorkerImplementation();\nworker.submitWork(() -> {\n    System.out.println(\"Processing Task 1\");\n});\nworker.submitWork(() -> {\n    System.out.println(\"Processing Task 2\");\n});\nSynchronization:\nworker.blockUntilComplete(); // Blocks until all tasks are completed\nSystem.out.println(\"All tasks finished!\");",

    "description": "Design and implement a Library Management system that caters to its registered members by cataloging and housing books that can be borrowed.\nCore Requirements:\nThe system must provide the following functionalities:\nAdd books to the catalog: Every book will be added by name and author and the program must generate a unique id for it by joining the first three letters of the author’s last name to a number to create a unique key. For example, a book by Rowling would have ROW1234 as a unique Id. Also, note that the library can have more than one copy for a book.\nRegister and unregister users in the Library\nReservation Management system: A user should be able to make a request to borrow a book from the library.\nUsers can borrow books by the book id (eg - ROW1234). For the scope of problems, let's assume users are aware of book id’s.\nIf the book is available and not borrowed by anyone, it should be reserved to the member’s name.\nIf the book is already borrowed by another user, the reservation system must add the requesting member to a FIFO waitlist of reservations. When the book is returned to the library, it will not be marked as available and will be available only to the first user under the FIFO queue\nIf the user is the first user of the FIFO waitlist, the book can be reserved under the user’s name\nFine calculation system: A user is allowed to borrow a book only for 14 days. If this time limit is exceeded at the time of return, the system should calculate a fine of 20 rupees per day for the number of days delay.\nGood To Have (Bonus):\nOne user should only be allowed to reserve one copy of the book\nAuditing: Design should cater to following use cases:\nGiven a bookId, give a list of users having that book\nGiven a userId, list of books issued to him\nOther details:\nUse of a DB is not allowed. We are expecting in-memory data structures to support the application.\nExpectations:\nFunctionally correct code (whatever feature is completed)\nCreate the sample data yourself. You can put it into a file, test case or main driver program itself. Unit test cases are not expected.\nCode should be demo-able.\nCode should be modular. Code should have basic OO design. Please do not jam the responsibilities of one class into another.\nCode should be extensible. Wherever applicable, use interfaces and contracts between different methods. It should be easy to add/remove functionality without re-writing the entire codebase.\nCode should handle edge cases properly and fail gracefully.\nCode should be legible and readable.\nCLI, Web based application, REST API and UI are not expected.\nGuidelines:\nPlease discuss the solution with an interviewer\nPlease do not access internet for anything EXCEPT syntax\nYou are free to use the language of your choice\nAll work should be your own\nPlease focus on the Bonus Feature only after ensuring the required features are complete and demoable.",

Your task is to determine the minimum total cost (i.e., sum of the weights of the selected edges) required to \"cut\" the tree such that all leaf nodes become disconnected from the root.\nCutting an edge means removing that edge from the tree. When an edge is cut, all nodes in the subtree rooted at the child of that edge become disconnected from the root. Your goal is to choose a set of edges to cut such that after the removals, there is no path from the root to any leaf, and the total cost is minimized.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains an integer N representing the number of nodes in the tree.\nThe following N-1 lines each contain three integers u, v, w, meaning there is an edge between node u and node v with weight w.\n(It is guaranteed that the given edges form a valid tree with node 1 as the root.)\nOutput Format:\nPrint a single integer representing the minimum cost required to disconnect all leaves from the root.\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5\n0 ≤ w ≤ 10^4\nExample:\nInput:\n4\n1 2 5\n1 3 1\n2 4 10\n\nOutput:\n6\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe binary tree structure is as follows:\n     1\n    / \\\n   2   3\n  /\n 4\n\nTotal cost = 5 + 1 = 6.",

In other words, if a message with the same content appears within 10 seconds of its first appearance, only the first occurrence should be kept. However, if the same message appears after 10 seconds have passed since its last occurrence, it should be considered a new occurrence and be included.\nFunction Specification:\nImplement the following function:\nList<Message> filterMessages(List<Message> messages);\nInput: A list of Message objects.\nOutput: A list of Message objects, filtered such that for each unique message content, only the first occurrence is kept within any 10-second window.\nAssumptions:\nThe receivedTime is given in seconds.\nThe list of messages may or may not be sorted by receivedTime. (If not, you may choose to sort the messages based on receivedTime before processing.)\nDuplicate messages are determined solely based on the content field.\nOnly duplicates that occur within 10 seconds after the first occurrence should be removed.\nExample:\nSuppose you have the following list of messages:\nMessage(\"Hello\", 5)\nMessage(\"Hi\", 6)\nMessage(\"Hello\", 10)\nMessage(\"Hello\", 17)\nMessage(\"Hi\", 12)\nProcessing:\n\"Hello\" at time 5 is the first occurrence, so keep it.\n\"Hi\" at time 6 is the first occurrence, so keep it.\n\"Hello\" at time 10 is a duplicate within 10 seconds of the first \"Hello\" (5 + 10 = 15), so discard it.\n\"Hello\" at time 17 is after 10 seconds have passed since the first \"Hello\", so it is a new occurrence and should be kept.\n\"Hi\" at time 12 is a duplicate within 10 seconds of the first \"Hi\" (6 + 10 = 16), so discard it.\nExpected Output:\n[\n  Message(\"Hello\", 5),\n  Message(\"Hi\", 6),\n  Message(\"Hello\", 17)\n]\nAdditional Challenge (Follow-up):\nRemove all the duplicates within 10 seconds even the first message shouldn't be present",

A closed island is an island that is completely surrounded by water on all four sides (i.e., none of its cells touches the boundary of the grid).\nYour task is to determine the number of closed islands in the grid.\nInput:\nA 2D grid of size m x n where 1 <= m, n <= 100 and each cell is either 0 or 1.\nOutput:\nAn integer representing the number of closed islands.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n[[1,1,1,1,1],\n [1,0,0,0,1],\n [1,0,1,0,1],\n [1,0,0,0,1],\n [1,1,1,1,1]]\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExplanation:\nThe group of 0s in the center forms a closed island because it is entirely surrounded by 1s.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n[[1,1,1,1],\n [1,0,0,1],\n [1,0,1,1],\n [1,1,1,1]]\n\nOutput: 1\n\nExplanation:\nThe island of 0s is completely enclosed by water (1s) on all sides, making it a closed island.\nExample 3:\nInput:\n[[0,0,0,0],\n [0,1,1,0],\n [0,1,1,0],\n [0,0,0,0]]\n\nOutput: 0\n\nExplanation: \nAlthough there is an \"island\" of 1s in the center, the surrounding 0s form a border that touches the grid boundary. Thus, there are no closed islands since any island touching the border is not considered closed.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n- `1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100`\n- `grid[i][j] ∈ {0, 1}`",

    "description": "Design and implement a user journey service for monitoring users as they navigate through various use cases. This will be a rule-based journey framework where a user will onboard a journey and move along various stages on the basis of specific conditions.\nRequirements:\nJourney:\njourney is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents a predefined path to track a user on.\nA journey consists of 'n' stages, and users must complete specific actions/events to advance to the next stage.\nMultiple users can onboard to the same journey.\nA user can onboard a journey only once.\nThere will be complete isolation across different journeys i.e. anything in one journey won’t depend on any other journey.\nourneys can be of 2 types, time-bound (having a start-date, end-date) and perpetual (no validity and will remain live till it’s active).\nFirst stage in the journey will be the onboarding stage, middle stages will be the onward stages and the final stage will be the terminal stage. We will have to mark the journey as active for it to be picked as part of the evaluation. By default on journey creation, it should be inactive. Also when the validity period of a journey is over, mark it inactive for time-bound journeys. Example:\nThere are 2 Journeys: J1 : Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3. Onboarding step for Stage 1 is login. For stage 2 is user opening recharge page and Stage 3 is user doing a recharge transaction\nJ2: Stage 1 -> Stage 2. Onboarding step is the user opening an upi lite account. For stage 2 is the user doing a top up on their upi lite account.\nLet's say there are 3 users: User 1: Logins to the app, hence is on stage 1 of J1. User opens the recharge page, at this time the user moves to stage 2 of J1. User 2: Logins to the app, hence is on stage 1 of J1. User opens the recharge page, at this time the user moves to stage 2 of J1 and then does a recharge transaction and is finally moved to stage 3 of J1 User 3: Logins to the app, hence is on stage 1 of J1. User opens up an upi account and is onboarded to J2.\nSo at this point of time, User 1 is at stage 2 of J1, User 2 is at stage 3 of J1 and User 3 is at stage 1 of J1 and stage 1 of J2.\nMandatory Implementations:\ncreateJourney(Journey journey) This will help in creating a journey in the system.\nupdateState(String JourneyId, boolean active) Mark journey as active/inactive.\ngetJourney(String journeyId) To get the journey details\nevaluate(String userId, Payload payload) Input payload can contain some fixed params and a Map of <key, value> Basis the payload, 3 things may happen:\nThe payload may match the condition for onboarding the user to a journey. In this case, the user will get onboarded to the journey. The payload may match the condition required for moving to the next stage for a user already onboarded on a specific stage. In this case, the user will move to the next stage in that journey. The payload will not match any condition, in this case it will be simply ignored. Users onboarding/transitions in a journey will happen only when the journey is ACTIVE.\ngetCurrentStage(String userId, String journeyId) Find the current stage of a user in the given journey id.\nisOnboarded(String userId, String journeyId) Return true/false basis on the condition that whether the user is part of the journey or not.\nOptional 1: Provide a way where we can send SMS to a user as soon as any stage transition happens for that user (onboarding to the journey or moving from one stage to another). It should have the capability to decide for which stage we want to provide this feature.\nOptional 2: Add support for recurring journeys, where a single user can onboard the journey multiple times.\nWhy the journey service?\nThis service serves as a platform for creating multiple journeys for different user paths and tracking users along the journey, taking business decisions accordingly in real time without the need of heavy database queries. Additionally, the service can trigger actions when users transition between stages or remain stationary at a particular stage for an extended period. For example, it can send notifications to users who have viewed a product but haven't made a purchase.\nSystem Architecture:\nImagine all the events of the entire product systems flowing to some message queue, and the journey service acting as one of the consumers of the messages. All the messages flowing in are being evaluated (as per the evaluate(String userId, Payload payload)) and this service keeping track of the user and journey status for real time use case by different product systems using getCurrentStage(String userId, String journeyId)\nPoints to note:\nYour code should cover all the mandatory functionalities explained above. Your code should be executable and clean. All necessary validations must be present. In case of an exception, proper errorCode must be present. Store the data in-memory for journeys and the user-transitions within the journey.",

    "description": "About Pendency System:\nPendency is a system that is able to track counts of in-flight/in-progress entities.\nThe system is told when to start tracking a particular entity, and when to stop. And at any point the system can be asked how many entities are in-progress (or in-flight). The system is expected to give this count, as fast as possible\nProblem Statement:\nYou need to design a system that is able to track pending entities.\nAn entity is identified using a unique ID and a list of hierarchical tags.\nThere are 3 parts to this problem statement. startTracking, endTracking and getCounts.\nWhen an entity is being tracked, you will be provided with an identifier for the entity, and a hierarchical tags associated with the entity to be tracked.\nWhen counts are being retrieved, you will be provided with a partial list of tags, for which the accumulated counts need to be returned. This partial list of tags will follow the same hierarchy order as given in the input. (Should become clear with the example shown below).\nThe following is a guide for the interfaces you may have in your system.\nAn interface to start tracking the counts for the entity. (increment count by 1)\nvoid startTracking (Integer id, List<String> hierarchicalTags);\nwhere,\nid = Identifier of the entity\nhierarchicalTags = Tags that are properties of the entity. These tags are hierarchical in nature.\n\nAn interface to stop tracking the entity that is already being tracked (reduce count by 1)\nvoid stopTracking (Integer id);\nwhere,\nid = Identifier of the transaction\n\nAn interface to get counts of entity being tracked, that match the tags supplied\nInteger getCounts (List<String> tags);\nwhere,\ntags = a hierarchy of tags, for which counts are to be retrieved\nSample: The following is just a sample for your understanding.\nPlease remember: You are expected to write the system which mirrors production quality code, rather than just implementing these functions\nThe sample below shows the ability to track in-flight transactions happening across instruments, states and cities:\nExamples for tracking and getting counts\nstartTracking(1112, [\"UPI\", \"Karnataka\", \"Bangalore\"]); \nstartTracking(2451, [\"UPI\", \"Karnataka\", \"Mysore\"]); \nstartTracking(3421, [\"UPI\", \"Rajasthan\", \"Jaipur\"]); \nstartTracking(1221, [\"Wallet\", \"Karnataka\", \"Bangalore\"]); \n\ngetCounts([\"UPI\"])   # represents the counts of all pending \"UPI\" transactions\nOutput: 3\ngetCounts([\"UPI\", \"Karnataka\"])  # represents the counts of all pending \"UPI\" transactions in \"Karnataka\"\nOutput: 2\ngetCounts([\"UPI\", \"Karnataka\", \"Bangalore\"]) # represents the counts of all pending \"UPI\" transactions in \"Karnataka\" and \"Bangalore\"\nOutput: 1\n\ngetCounts([\"Bangalore\"]) # Does not represent a valid hierarchy in the sample\nOutput: 0\n\nstartTracking(4221, [\"Wallet\", \"Karnataka\", \"Bangalore\"]); \nstopTracking(1112); \nstopTracking(2451); \n\ngetCounts([\"UPI\"])\nOutput: 1\ngetCounts([\"Wallet\"])\nOutput: 2\ngetCounts([\"UPI\", \"Karnataka\", \"Bangalore\"])\nOutput: 0",

No account can contain balance less than 0.\nRequirements\nThe smallest amount that the users can transfer is F₹ 0.0001. The description of the wallet operations follows.\nThe command CreateWallet creates a new wallet with a balance of F₹ in the name of .\nThe command TransferMoney would decrease F₹ from accountHolder1’s account and add the same amount in accountHolder2’s account.\nThe command Statement should display the account statement for accountHolder1’s account. The account statement should contain all the transactions made in that account.\nThe command Overview should display the current balance of all the accounts.\nYour wallet system also provides some offers to the customers.\nOffer 1: When customer A transfers money to customer B and both the account holders have the same balance after the transaction then both the customers get F₹ 10 as a reward.\nOffer 2: Whenever the command Offer2 is fired 3 customers with the highest number of transactions will get F₹ 10, F₹ 5, and F₹ 2 as rewards. If there is a tie (customers having the same number of transactions) then the customer having higher account balance should be given preference. If there is still a tie then the customer whose account was created first should be given preference.\nBonus\nAdd a command called FixedDeposit <fd_amount>. Whenever the command is fired an amount equal to <fd_amount> is parked for . If for the next 5 transactions the account balance for that remains above <fd_amount> the gets F₹ 10 as interest. If the account balance goes below <fd_amount> then the FD should be dissolved and the user would need to give the FixedDeposit command again to start a new FD.\nAs an added bonus display the <fd_amount> and remaining transactions in the Overview and Statement command also.\nSample\nInput:\nCreateWallet Harry 100\nCreateWallet Ron 95.7\nCreateWallet Hermione 104\nCreateWallet Albus 200\nCreateWallet Draco 500\nOverview\n\nOutput:\nHarry 100\nRon 95.7\nHermione 104\nAlbus 200\nDraco 500\n\nInput:\nTransferMoney Albus Draco 30\nTransferMoney Hermione Harry 2\nTransferMoney Albus Ron 5\nOverview\n\nOutput:\nHarry 112\nRon 100.7\nHermione 112\nAlbus 165\nDraco 530\n\nInput:\nStatement Harry\n\nOutput:\nHermione credit 2\nOffer1 credit 10\n\nInput:\nStatement Albus\n\nOutput:\nDraco debit 30\nRon debit 5\n\nInput:\nOffer2\nOverview\n\nOutput:\nHarry 114\nRon 100.7\nHermione 112\nAlbus 175\nDraco 535\nNotes\nCode should be demo-able\nCode should be modular\nInput can be taken from command line or file or by hard coding a single string in your code\nYou are expected to find and handle all corner cases and data validations\nAll data should be stored in memory.

    "description": "Design a system that, given a continuous stream of sentences, can predict the most frequent word that follows a given input word. The system should allow for O(1) time complexity for each prediction.\nInput:\nA list of sentences, where each sentence is a string of words separated by spaces.\nOutput:\nA function that, given an input word, returns the most frequent word that directly follows it in the stream of sentences.\nExample 1:\nInput: [\"I am happy\", \"Happy people laugh\", \"I am sad\", \"I enjoy running\", \"I enjoy reading\", \"I enjoy singing\"]\nPrediction Request: \"I\"\nOutput: \"enjoy\"\nExplanation: The word \"I\" is followed by \"am\" twice and \"enjoy\" three times. Therefore, \"enjoy\" is the most frequent successor.\nExample 2:\nInput: [\"She loves apples\", \"He loves oranges\", \"She loves bananas\", \"He enjoys apples\"]\nPrediction Request: \"loves\"\nOutput: \"apples\"\nExplanation: The word \"loves\" is followed by \"apples\" and \"bananas\" once each. Since \"apples\" comes first lexicographically, it is returned.\nConstraints:\nThe system should handle updates efficiently as new sentences arrive.\nThe prediction function must operate in O(1) time.\nAssume all input words are lowercase and consist only of alphabetic characters.\nFollow-up Questions:\nEfficient Frequency Updates: How can the system efficiently update word pair frequencies when new sentences are added to the stream?\nPredicting Multiple Next Words: How can the system be adapted to predict the top N most frequent words following a given input word?",

Each computer operates independently and possesses a local clock. Due to various factors, these clocks may drift apart over time, leading to synchronization issues within the network.\nYour task is to implement an algorithm that synchronizes all computers in this circular network, ensuring that all local clocks are aligned within a specified precision. The synchronization should be achieved by leveraging the direct communication between neighboring computers.\nInput:\nAn integer N representing the number of computers in the network.\nA list of N floating-point numbers, where the i-th number denotes the initial time offset of the i-th computer's clock relative to a global reference time.\nA floating-point number precision indicating the acceptable maximum difference between any two synchronized clocks.\nOutput:\nA list of N floating-point numbers representing the adjusted time offsets for each computer after synchronization.

Your task is to determine an array answer of length n, where answer[i] is the minimum number of operations required to move all balls to the i-th box.\nInput:\nA binary string boxes of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), where each character is either '0' or '1'.\nOutput:\nAn array answer of length n, where answer[i] represents the minimum number of operations needed to move all balls to the i-th box.\nExample:\nInput:\nboxes = \"110\"\n\nOutput:\n[1, 1, 3]\n\nExplanation:\n- To move all balls to the first box (`i=0`), one operation is needed to move the ball from the second box to the first box.\n- To move all balls to the second box (`i=1`), one operation is needed to move the ball from the first box to the second box.\n- To move all balls to the third box (`i=2`), two operations are needed to move the ball from the first box to the third box, and one operation to move the ball from the second box to the third box, totaling three operations.\nConstraints:\nn == boxes.length\n1 ≤ n ≤ 2000\nEach character in boxes is either '0' or '1'.",

Each cell in the maze is either:\nAn empty cell represented by '.'\nA wall represented by '+'\nYou are also given an array entrance = [entrance_row, entrance_col] representing the row and column of the entrance cell in the maze.\nIn one step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze.\nYour goal is to find the nearest exit from the entrance. An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the border of the maze. The entrance does not count as an exit.\nReturn the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit, or -1 if no such path exists.\nInput:\nmaze: A list of lists representing the maze grid, where each element is either '.' or '+'.\nentrance: A list [entrance_row, entrance_col] representing the coordinates of the entrance cell.\nOutput:\nAn integer representing the minimum number of steps to reach the nearest exit from the entrance. If no exit is reachable, return -1.\nExamples:\nExample 1:\nInput:\nmaze = [\n  [\"+\", \"+\", \".\", \"+\"],\n  [\"+\", \".\", \".\", \"+\"],\n  [\"+\", \"+\", \"+\", \".\"]\n]\nentrance = [1, 2]\n\nOutput:\n1\n\nExplanation:\nThere are three exits in this maze at `[0,2]`, and `[2,3]`.\nThe entrance is at `[1,2]`.\nYou can reach `[0,2]` by moving 1 step up.\n\nThus, the nearest exit is `[0,2]`, which is 1 step away.\nExample 2:\nInput:\nmaze = [\n  [\"+\", \"+\", \"+\"],\n  [\".\", \".\", \".\"],\n  [\"+\", \"+\", \"+\"]\n]\nentrance = [1, 0]\n\nOutput:\n2\n\nExplanation:\n\nThere is one exit in this maze at `[1,2]`.\nThe entrance is at `[1,0]`, which is not an exit.\nYou can reach `[1,2]` by moving 2 steps right.\nThus, the nearest exit is `[1,2]`, which is 2 steps away.\nConstraints:\nmaze.length == m\nmaze[i].length == n\n1 <= m, n <= 100\nmaze[i][j] is either '.' or '+'.\nentrance.length == 2\n0 <= entrance_row < m\n0 <= entrance_col < n\n`maze[entrance_row][entrance_col] == '.'",

(They will ask about different approaches you can take to avoid starvation of any player)\nConstraints:\nSingle-team exclusivity: Only one team can access the playground at a time.\nMax capacity: A maximum of 10 players from that team can be inside the playground concurrently.\nMultiple teams may attempt to enter the playground simultaneously, but only one team's players should be allowed at a time.\nTask:\nImplement the synchronization logic to ensure:\nOnly players from a single team are allowed at any time.\nUp to 10 players from that team can be in the playground concurrently.\nOnce the playground is vacant, a waiting team (if any) is allowed to enter.\nYour design should handle concurrent access and avoid deadlocks and starvation.\nFollow up:\nHow would you prevent starvation? No team or player should be perpetually blocked from access.",

Advertisers also keep their advertisement budget on the platform.\nUser: An entity that uses the platform and consumes advertisements with other use cases on the platform.\nBid Amount: Bid amount is the amount earned per advertisement by the platform from the advertiser. If the Bid amount is higher, then there are more chances of the advertisement getting served to the customer.\nAdvertisement Campaign: The Advertiser creates advertisement campaigns on the platform. The advertiser provides info such as URL, content_type (image, video), and bid per Ad. matching, and targeting attributes such as age, interest, and gender, etc., with the campaign.\nSystem Constraints: The Platform will have some constraints and will be checked against all the advertisements before matching.\nAdvertisement Matching: The platform provides advertisements, comparing user details and attributes with all the active campaign requirements. It also compares the bid amount with the existing budget and checks for all the given system constraints for advertisement serving to find the best-matching advertisement. Once an advertisement is served, the budget is reduced from the advertiser’s account.

But there are rules to keep in mind:\nA valid decoding uses either one or two digits at a time.\nThe group of digits must map to a valid letter (i.e., from \"1\" to \"26\").\nAny segment like \"06\" is invalid because '6' is valid, but '06' is not (leading zeroes are not allowed).\nIf there’s no way to decode the message, return 0.\nYour task is to compute the total number of valid decodings for the given string.\nInput\nA single string s consisting only of digits (0-9)\nLength: 1 <= s.length <= 100\nOutput\nReturn an integer: the total number of ways the message can be decoded.\nExamples:\nInput: \"14\"  \nOutput: 2  \nExplanation: \"AD\" (1,4) and \"N\" (14)\n\nInput: \"05\"  \nOutput: 0  \nExplanation: No valid way to decode a message that starts with \"0\"\n\nInput: \"11106\"  \nOutput: 2  \nExplanation: Valid decodings:\n- \"AAJF\" (1,1,10,6)\n- \"KJF\"  (11,10,6)\n(\"06\" is not a valid code)",

    "description": "You are asked to design a Logger class to simulate a simplified process execution system. This logger will receive streamed inputs in the form of function calls and must maintain information about different processes based on their start and end times.\nThe logger must support the following operations:\nstartTime(process_id, start_time)\nIndicates that the process with ID process_id started at time start_time.\nendTime(process_id, end_time)\nIndicates that the process with ID process_id completed at time end_time.\nprint()\nPrints the details of all completed processes sorted by their start time.\nEach process must be printed in the format: Process <process_id> started at <start_time> and ended at <end_time>\nOnly processes that have both start and end times registered will be printed.\nThe system behaves like a stream processor, meaning the function calls can come in any order, and you should maintain state accordingly.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nlogger.startTime(101, 5)  \nlogger.startTime(102, 2)  \nlogger.endTime(102, 7)  \nlogger.print()\n\nOutput:\nProcess 102 started at 2 and ended at 7\n\nExplanation\nOnly process 102 is completed by the time `print()` is called. Process 101 has no end time logged yet, so it is not printed.\nExample 2:\nInput:\nlogger.endTime(201, 15)  \nlogger.startTime(201, 10)  \nlogger.startTime(202, 5)  \nlogger.endTime(202, 9)  \nlogger.print()\n\nOutput:\nProcess 202 started at 5 and ended at 9  \nProcess 201 started at 10 and ended at 15\n\nExplanation\nAlthough `endTime` was called before `startTime` for process 201, the system handles it correctly. All completed processes are printed in order of start time.\nConstraints:\nAll process IDs are unique positive integers.\nTime values are positive integers.\nThere can be up to 10^5 function calls.\nFunction calls may arrive in any order.\nThe print() function can be called multiple times, and should reflect the current state of completed processes each time.\nEach process will have only one start and one end call.\nstart_time < end_time will always hold true.",

Player 1 moves first.\nOn each turn, a player can pick a number only from one of the ends of the array - either nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1].\nThe picked number is added to the player's score, and the number is removed from the array.\nThe game ends when there are no numbers left in the array.\nYour task is to return true if Player 1 can win the game or draw, assuming both players play optimally.

    "description": "Implement a Movie Ticket Booking Application for a Theatre. Refer to the following details:\nA Theatre has Screens that run Shows for different Movies. Each Show has a particular Movie, start time, duration, and is played in a particular Screen in the theatre. Each Screen has an arrangement of Seats that can be booked by Users.\nAssume all Users are registered, authenticated, and logged in to the Application.\nOnce a User selects a particular show to book tickets for, a UserBookingSession starts. Within this UserBookingSession, a User will be able to get the Available Seats for the show and select the Seats he wishes to book. It is a ‘good to have’ for the Application to have limits on the number of seats a User can book in a Ticket.\nOnce the user has selected a group of seats, these seats should become TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE to all other Users.\nThe User then proceeds to make payment which can either be SUCCESS or FAILURE.\nIf Payment FAILED, user can retry Payment for a maximum number of times. Beyond maximum retries, the seats are made AVAILABLE.\nIf Payment SUCCEEDS, Ticket or Booking Confirmation is generated and made available to the User. The UserBookingSession is closed and the Seats are made PERMANENTLY_UNAVAILABLE.\nA User can also explicitly close the UserBookingSession after selecting seats and before making payment. In this case, the seats selected are made AVAILABLE once again.\nDemonstrate the following scenarios:\n2 concurrent Users U1, U2 in the application. The Users can retrieve Available Shows and select one show.\nCase 1:\nSay U1 and U2 select same show.\nU1 requests for and gets all Available Seats for this show.\nU1 selects group of seats and proceeds to pay.\nU2 requests for and gets all Available Seats for this show. U2 should not see the seats selected by U1 as AVAILABLE. 5 .Payment succeeded for U1.\nU1 receives Ticket with Seats confirmed.\nCase 2:\nSay U1 and U2 select same show.\nU1 and U2 requests for and gets all Available Seats for this show.\nU1 selects group of seats.\nU1 proceeds to pay.\nU2 requests for and gets all Available Seats for this show. U2 should NOT see the seats selected by U1 as AVAILABLE.\nPayment failed for U1. Assume maximum retries as zero just for the demo. Also show in another scenario where U1’s UserBookingSession is explicitly closed by U1 before payment is completed.\nU2 again requests for and gets all Available Seats for this show. U2 should now see the seats previously selected by U1 as AVAILABLE.\nCase 3:\nSay U1 and U2 select same show.\nU1 and U2 request for and get all Available Seats for this show.\nU1 selects group of seats and proceeds to pay.\nU2 selects overlapping group of seats and proceeds to pay. U2 should be notified that “one or more of the selected seats are not available at this moment”.\nBonus:\nHave a configurable timeout for a UserBookingSession. Show that if User selects and Payment is not completed by timeout, then the UserBookingSession is closed and the seats selected are made AVAILABLE.\nHandling concurrency in the system so that one seat is not allotted to 2 users if they try to book at the same time.\nExpectations\nCreate the sample data yourself. You can put it into a file, test case or main driver program itself.\nCode should be demo-able. Either by using a main driver program or test cases.\nCode should be modular. Code should have basic OO design. Please do not jam in responsibilities of one class into another.\nCode should be extensible. Wherever applicable, use interfaces and contracts between different methods. It should be easy to add/remove functionality without re­writing entire codebase.\nCode should handle edge cases properly and fail gracefully.\nCode should be legible, readable and DRY\nGuidelines\nUse of DB not expected. You can store data in memory.\nPlease discuss the solution with an interviewer\nPlease do not access internet for anything EXCEPT syntax\nYou are free to use the language of your choice\nAll code should be your own\nPlease focus on the Bonus questions only after ensuring the required features are complete and demoable.",

    "description": "You are given a list of bombs placed in a 2D plane. Each bomb has a **circular range of effect**, and when detonated, it can trigger other bombs within its range. This can potentially cause a **chain reaction** where one bomb sets off others, and so on.\n\nThe bombs are represented as a 2D list:\n\n```\nbombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]\n```\n\nWhere:\n* `xi`, `yi` are the coordinates of the i-th bomb.\n* `ri` is the radius of its range (a circular area centered at (xi, yi)).\n\nYour task is to **detonate exactly one bomb** and simulate the full chain reaction that follows. You need to return the **maximum number of bombs that can be detonated** if you choose the starting bomb optimally.\n\nNote: A bomb `A` can detonate another bomb `B` **only if B lies within A&#39;s range**, i.e., the **Euclidean distance** between the centers of A and B is **less than or equal to A&#39;s radius**.\n\n###### Example 1:\n```\nInput: \nbombs = [[1, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 2]]\n\nOutput: \n3\n\nExplanation  \nIf you detonate the first bomb at (1,1), it sets off the second bomb at (2,2), which in turn detonates the third at (3,3).  \nAll 3 bombs are detonated.\n```\n\n###### Example 2:\n```\nInput: \nbombs = [[1, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1], [5, 2, 1]]\n\nOutput: \n1\n\nExplanation  \nNone of the bombs are close enough to each other to cause a chain reaction. So the best you can do is detonate just one bomb.\n```\n\n###### Constraints:\n* `1 &lt;= bombs.length &lt;= 100`\n* `0 &lt;= xi, yi &lt;= 10^5`\n* `1 &lt;= ri &lt;= 10^5`\n* The answer will always fit in a 32-bit signed integer.\n* No two bombs are at the exact same position.

    "description": "Design a simple utility that can **encode** and **decode** a blob-like data object into and from a string representation. A blob here refers to a collection of key-value pairs, where each value is a string. The primary goal is to **compactly serialize** the data and later **restore it accurately**.\n\nThe encoder should take a dictionary or map-like structure and convert it into a single string.\nThe decoder should parse the string and restore the original object, maintaining the integrity of all key-value pairs.\n\nThe encoding scheme must meet the following conditions:\n\n1. It should handle empty strings, special characters (e.g., `=`, `;`, `\\`), and Unicode safely.\n2. Keys and values are both strings. Keys are unique.\n3. The resulting encoded string should be human-readable and compact.\n4. The decode function should be the exact inverse of the encode function.\n\nYou are to implement two functions:\n\n* `encode(blob: Dict[str, str]) -&gt; str`\n* `decode(data: str) -&gt; Dict[str, str]`\n\n###### Example 1:\n```\nInput: \nencode({\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;,\n  &quot;age&quot;: &quot;30&quot;\n})\n\nOutput: \n&quot;name=Alice;age=30&quot;\n\nExplanation  \nEach key-value pair is represented as key=value, and pairs are separated by `;`.\n```\n\n---\n\n###### Example 2:\n\n```\nInput: \nencode({\n  &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Hello=World;&quot;,\n  &quot;lang&quot;: &quot;en;us&quot;\n})\n\nOutput: \n&quot;message=Hello\\=World\\;;lang=en\\;us&quot;\n\nExplanation  \nSpecial characters `=` and `;` are escaped using a backslash `\\`.  \nOriginal data is preserved during decoding.\n```\n\n---\n\n###### Example 3:\n\n```\nInput: \ndecode(&quot;message=Hello\\\\=World\\\\;;lang=en\\\\;us&quot;)\n\nOutput: \n{\n  &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Hello=World;&quot;,\n  &quot;lang&quot;: &quot;en;us&quot;\n}\n\nExplanation  \nAll escape sequences are correctly unescaped to reconstruct original strings.\n```\n\n---\n\n###### Constraints:\n\n* Total number of key-value pairs: `1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^4`\n* Keys are unique, non-empty, and do not contain escape characters (`\\`)\n* Each key and value has length up to `10^4`\n* Must use constant extra space per character during encoding/decoding (no nested parsing libraries) Whatever kind of mentorship session you need.

The operations team wants to roll out a centralized dashboarding system that provides real-time visibility into the status and performance of various operational sites, for example, Fulfillment Centers (FCs), warehouses, or data hubs.\nEach site independently tracks key metrics such as:\nScanner/device uptime\nThroughput (items processed per minute/hour)\nIncident rates (errors, timeouts, task delays)\nSystem health (CPU, memory, network usage of edge devices)\nYou are asked to design a system that supports two types of views:\nSite-Level Dashboard: Displays real-time and historical data for a specific location. This view is used by on-site engineers and managers to monitor their own facility’s performance.\nMaster/Global Dashboard: Aggregates data across all sites, allows filtering by region, country, or custom tags, and enables high-level insights for executives and central operations teams.\nYour system must support:\nReal-time ingestion and processing of metrics (within 5–10 seconds)\nFiltering, sorting, and drill-down into specific sites from the master view\nConfigurable alerting for threshold breaches\nRole-based access (e.g., site manager vs central admin)\nHistorical trends for up to 30 days\nExample Scenario:\nInput: \nSite-A sends:\n  - 60 active scanners\n  - 2 scanners offline for 15+ mins\n  - 8,000 items picked in last hour\n\nSite-B sends:\n  - 40 active scanners\n  - 0 offline\n  - 6,500 items picked\n\nUser opens global dashboard and selects “All Sites → Region: West Coast”\n\nOutput:\n- Aggregated scanner uptime (across filtered sites)\n- Alerts for Site-A due to device offline\n- Option to click into Site-A to view metrics over the last 24 hours\nConstraints:\nUp to 5,000 sites reporting metrics\nEach site can emit 100+ metrics every minute\nAll data must be ingested and made queryable within 5 seconds\nData should be retained for 30 days (cold + hot storage)\nUsers must not experience dashboard lag greater than 1 second\nSystem must scale horizontally without affecting SLA",

For example, an admin might want to block an IP for just 24 hours.\nKey System Goals:\nSpeed: The check for a blocked IP must be incredibly fast, with latency in the low milliseconds.\nScale: The system must be able to handle a massive number of checks per second and store a list of potentially billions of blocked IPs.\nReliability: The service needs to be highly available. If it goes down, the main application could be vulnerable.",

After inserting \"app\", searching \"app\" returns true.\nExample 2 (with delete):\nInput:\nconst trie = new Trie();\ntrie.insert(\"hello\");\ntrie.insert(\"hell\");\ntrie.delete(\"hello\");    // true\ntrie.search(\"hello\");    // false\ntrie.search(\"hell\");     // true\n\nOutput:\ntrue\nfalse\ntrue\nExplanation: Deleting \"hello\" should not remove the node path required for the existing word \"hell\".\nConstraints:\nWords contain only lowercase/uppercase English letters (specify allowed charset in your implementation if you prefer).\ninsert, search, and startsWith should run in O(L) time where L is the length of the input string.\nImplement using TypeScript classes and types (no use of third-party trie libraries).\nIf implementing delete, make sure to free/truncate nodes only when they are no longer needed by other words.",

    "description": "You are given a textual representation of a folder tree. Each line represents a node and uses a simple marker to indicate hierarchy. Your task is to parse the text input and render a nested HTML list structure (<ul> / <li>) that reflects the folder hierarchy.\nInput format (example):\nEach node line starts with an indent that uses spaces, followed by the marker |- and then the node name.\nIndentation defines depth. A deeper indentation means a child of the previous shallower node.\nNode names contain no newline characters.\nExample input:\n|- A\n|- B\n   |- C\n   |- D\n|- E\nExpected HTML output (conceptual):\n<ul>\n  <li>A</li>\n  <li>B\n    <ul>\n      <li>C</li>\n      <li>D</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>E</li>\n</ul>\nYour function should:\nParse the input string.\nReturn a string containing properly nested <ul> / <li> elements, preserving the order of nodes.\nRequirements:\nHandle arbitrary depths.\nTreat different amounts of indentation consistently (you may choose to treat indentation in multiples of N spaces but document your assumption).\nIgnore blank lines.\nProduce minimal and well-formed HTML (close all opened tags properly).\nExample 1:\nInput:\n|- root\n   |- child1\n      |- grandchild1\n   |- child2\n\nOutput (formatted here for readability):\n<ul>\n  <li>root\n    <ul>\n      <li>child1\n        <ul>\n          <li>grandchild1</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>child2</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\nExplanation:\nIndentation indicates nesting; child nodes appear as nested `<ul>` under their parent `<li>`.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n|- A\n|- B\n   |- C\n|- D\n\nOutput:\n<ul>\n  <li>A</li>\n  <li>B\n    <ul>\n      <li>C</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>D</li>\n</ul>\n\nExplanation:\nNodes A, B, and D are top-level. C is nested under B.\nClarifications & Constraints:\nIndentation rule: For this problem, assume indentation is represented by groups of 3 spaces per level (as in the example above where child lines are prefixed by 3 spaces). You may state a different consistent rule if you implement it; tests should match that rule.\nLines always contain marker |- after indentation; invalid lines can be ignored or cause an error depending on your chosen behavior.\nInput size: up to 10,000 lines, aim for an algorithm that is O(N) in the number of lines.\nOutput may be either an HTML string or a DOM structure (e.g., a top-level <ul> element) depending on runtime environment; specify which in your implementation.",

    "description": "Design and implement an Employee Access Management subsystem. This LLD exercise focuses on three primary operations that you have to implement and justify:\ngrant(employeeId, resourceId, permission, metadata) - grant the given permission on a resource to an employee.\nrevoke(employeeId, resourceId, permission) - revoke a previously granted permission.\nget(employeeId, resourceId) - return the effective set of permissions the employee currently has on the resource, including any metadata (who granted it, when it expires, source: direct grant vs role/group).\nKey Requirements\nCore operations\ngrant(employeeId, resourceId, permission, metadata):\nGrants a permission (e.g., read, write, admin) to an employee for a given resource.\nmetadata can include grantedBy, grantedAt, expiresAt (optional), reason.\nMultiple grants may exist for the same employee+resource (e.g., different permissions or overlapping grants).\nrevoke(employeeId, resourceId, permission):\nRemoves the specific permission. If the permission was granted multiple times (e.g., from a role and direct grant), the revoke should only remove the specified grant type.\nget(employeeId, resourceId):\nReturns the effective permission set for that employee on that resource (e.g., {read: true, write: false, admin: false}), and provenance information (source role, direct grant, expiry).\nExtensions\nSupport direct grants; design should allow easy extension to roles/groups and policy-based grants.\nHandle time-bound grants (expired grants must not be considered effective).\nRespect an order of precedence you define (e.g., explicit deny can override grants; role grants vs direct grants).",

    "description": "You are given an in-memory log of friendship events in a fixed textual format:\n<timestamp> <NameA> became friend to <NameB>.\n<timestamp> is a non-negative integer (seconds since epoch).\n<NameA> and <NameB> are case-sensitive strings without spaces (e.g., Ram, Shyam).\nThe phrase is exactly \"became friend to\" and each line ends with a dot.\nTwo users are considered connected if there is a path of friendships between them (directly or indirectly). At time t, all events with timestamps <= t have taken effect.\nYour task is to return the earliest timestamp at which every user who ever appears in the log becomes connected in a single friendship network. If this never happens, return -1.\nNotes:\nThe log is not a stream; assume the entire list of lines fits in memory.\nMultiple events can share the same timestamp; process all of them for that time.\nNames may appear for the first time late in the log—treat every distinct name as a distinct user.\nDuplicate friendship lines (same pair, any order) have no additional effect.\nExample 1:\nInput: \nlines = [\n  \"455456 Ram became friend to Shyam.\",\n  \"455459 Ramesh became friend to Mahesh.\",\n  \"455465 Moham became friend to Ram.\",\n  \"455489 Shyam became friend to Mahesh.\"\n]\n\nOutput: \n455489\n\nExplanation\nDistinct users are {Ram, Shyam, Ramesh, Mahesh, Moham}.  \nSort by timestamp and union pairs as they occur:\n- 455456: Connect Ram–Shyam. Components: {Ram, Shyam}, {Ramesh}, {Mahesh}, {Moham}\n- 455459: Connect Ramesh–Mahesh. Components: {Ram, Shyam}, {Ramesh, Mahesh}, {Moham}\n- 455465: Connect Moham–Ram. Components: {Ram, Shyam, Moham}, {Ramesh, Mahesh}\n- 455489: Connect Shyam–Mahesh, which merges the two groups.  \nAll 5 users are connected at 455489, so return 455489.\nExample 2:\nInput: \nlines = [\n  \"10 A became friend to B.\",\n  \"20 C became friend to D.\",\n  \"30 E became friend to F.\"\n]\n\nOutput: \n-1\n\nExplanation\nUsers form separate components {A,B}, {C,D}, {E,F} and never merge into a single connected network. Hence the network never becomes fully connected.\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ number of log lines ≤ 2 × 10^5\n0 ≤ timestamp ≤ 10^9\nName length: 1–32 characters; names contain only letters and digits (no spaces).\nTotal number of distinct users ≤ 2 × number of log lines.\nTime complexity target: O(L log L α(U)) where L is number of lines, U is number of unique users, and α is the inverse Ackermann function (near-constant), achievable via sorting by timestamp + Union–Find.\nMemory: O(U)",

If the book already exists, update its score.\nget(): Retrieve the book with the highest score.\nAfter retrieval, the book’s score decreases by 1.\nThe retrieved book becomes temporarily ineligible for the next get() call.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nBookManager bm = new BookManager()\nbm.insert(101, 5)\nbm.insert(102, 7)\nbm.insert(103, 6)\n\nbm.get()\nbm.get()\nbm.get()\nbm.get()\n\nOutput:\n102\n103\n102\n101\n\nExplanation:\n- First get(): Book 102 has highest score (7). After retrieval, score reduces to 6 and it becomes temporarily ineligible.\n- Second get(): Book 103 (score 6) is chosen. Now 103’s score becomes 5 and it becomes ineligible.\n- Third get(): Book 102 is eligible again (score 6) and retrieved. Score becomes 5 and it becomes ineligible for the next get.\n- Fourth get():  All books have score 5. Book 102 is ineligible. So either Book 101 or Book 103 can be given.\nConstraints:\nNumber of books ≤ 10^5\nScore of each book: 1 ≤ score ≤ 10^9\nBook number: unique integer identifier\nDelay d: 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5\nFollow-up 1: Extend the logic so that once a book is retrieved, it becomes ineligible for the next n calls to get(). The value of n should be configurable when initializing the BookManager.\nFollow-up 2: Now each book also has an associated delay. Once a book is retrieved at time T1, it should not be eligible again until T1 + book.delay. If multiple books have the same highest score, return the one with the smaller book number.\nExample 2 (with delay logic):\nInput:\nBookManager bm = new BookManager()\nbm.insert(201, 4, delay=2)\nbm.insert(202, 5, delay=3)\n\nbm.get()   // at time 1\nbm.get()   // at time 2\nbm.get()   // at time 3\nbm.get()   // at time 4\nbm.get()   // at time 5\n\nOutput:\n202\n201\n-1\n202\n201\n\nExplanation:\n- At time 1: Book 202 retrieved (score 5→4), next eligible at time 1+3=4.\n- At time 2: Book 201 retrieved (score 4→3), next eligible at time 2+2=4.\n- At time 3: Neither book eligible → return -1.\n- At time 4: Book 202 eligible again, retrieved.\n- At time 5: Book 201 eligible again, retrieved.",

Print the result modulo 998244353.\nInput Format:\nA single line with two integers n and k.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer: the sum of costs over all arrays of length n with elements in {1,...,k}, taken modulo 998244353.\nExample 1:\nInput: \n3 2\n\nOutput: \n6\n\nExplanation\nThere are 2^3 = 8 arrays of length 3 over {1,2}. For k = 2 each contiguous subarray of length 2 is a permutation if it is [1,2] or [2,1]. The arrays that contain at least one such length-2 permutation subarray are:\n[1,1,2], [1,2,1], [1,2,2], [2,1,1], [2,1,2], [2,2,1].\nEach of those arrays has cost 1 (since any two length-2 subarrays overlap, you can select at most one). Summing costs gives 6.\nExample 2:\nInput: \n4 3\n\nOutput: \n30\n\nExplanation\nThere are 3^4 = 81 arrays of length 4 over {1,2,3}. For each array compute the maximal number of disjoint length-3 subarrays that are permutations of {1,2,3}. Summing those costs across all 81 arrays yields 30.\nConstraints:\n2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 4000\nCompute the answer modulo 998244353.",

    "description": "You are building a traffic light controller for a single intersection of two perpendicular roads:\nRoad A (north–south): directions 1 (N→S) and 2 (S→N)\nRoad B (west–east): directions 3 (W→E) and 4 (E→W)\nThere is one traffic light per road (A and B). A light is either green (both directions on that road may cross) or red (both directions must wait). At no time may both roads be green simultaneously.\nInitially, Road A is green and Road B is red.\nWhen a road is green, any number of cars on that road (in either direction) may cross, but no car from the other road may cross until the light flips.\nFlipping the light switches which road is green; you must not call the flip operation if the current road is already green.\nMultiple cars arrive over time, possibly concurrently, and your solution must be deadlock-free (no cars remain blocked forever if progress is possible).\nNo two cars from different roads may be in the intersection at the same time.\nYou are given a function to implement that will be invoked by each car’s thread upon arrival:\nvoid carArrived(\n    int carId,                 // unique id of the arriving car\n    int roadId,                // 1 = Road A, 2 = Road B\n    int direction,             // 1=N→S, 2=S→N, 3=W→E, 4=E→W\n    function<void()> turnGreen,// call this to turn the light green for roadId (only if currently red)\n    function<void()> crossCar  // call this when the car actually crosses\n)\nRequirements:\nEnsure mutual exclusion between roads: while one road is crossing, the other must not enter.\nEnsure no deadlocks: cars must eventually cross according to the rules.\nDo not call turnGreen() if roadId already has green.\nWhen the light flips to a road, all waiting cars on that road should be allowed to cross (one by one calling crossCar()), until a flip is required again.\nYou may use any standard concurrency primitives (mutexes, condition variables, semaphores, monitors, etc.).\nDo not introduce extra output; the only side effects should be legitimate calls to turnGreen() and crossCar() following the constraints.\nExample 1:\nInput (arrival events in time order):\nt=1: carId=101, roadId=1, direction=1\nt=2: carId=102, roadId=1, direction=2\nt=3: carId=201, roadId=2, direction=3\n\nPossible Output (sequence of operations):\ncrossCar(101)\ncrossCar(102)\nturnGreen()           // flip to Road B\ncrossCar(201)\n\nExplanation\nRoad A starts green, so cars 101 and 102 (both on Road A) may cross without flipping. When car 201 arrives on Road B, it must wait until Road A finishes, then the controller flips using turnGreen() and allows 201 to cross.\nExample 2:\nInput:\nt=1: carId=301, roadId=2, direction=4\nt=2: carId=103, roadId=1, direction=1\nt=3: carId=302, roadId=2, direction=3\nt=4: carId=104, roadId=1, direction=2\n\nPossible Output:\ncrossCar(103)         // Road A is initially green\ncrossCar(104)\nturnGreen()           // flip to Road B once A is idle\ncrossCar(301)\ncrossCar(302)\n\nExplanation\nEven though a Road B car (301) arrives first, the light is initially green for Road A. The controller lets A’s cars go first without flipping prematurely, then flips once A becomes idle, and processes waiting Road B cars. At no point is turnGreen() called when its road is already green.\nConstraints:\nUp to 10^4 arriving cars; arrival order is non-decreasing in time but may be concurrent.\nturnGreen() must be called only when flipping from the other road to roadId.\ncrossCar() must be called with mutual exclusion across roads; cars on the same road may cross one at a time (no overlapping calls), but never overlap with cars from the other road.\nYour implementation must be deadlock-free and race-condition safe.\nNo fairness guarantee is mandated beyond deadlock freedom, but starving one road indefinitely is considered poor behavior in interviews; design for reasonable alternation when both sides have demand.",

Each time slot is represented as an array [start, end], meaning the person is available from time start to time end (both inclusive). You are also given a meeting duration.\nYou need to find the earliest time slot that works for both people and is at least duration long. If such a slot exists, return it as [start, start + duration]. If there is no such common time slot, return an empty array [].\nIt is guaranteed that within each person’s availability, the slots do not overlap.\nInput Format:\nFirst line: integer n1, number of slots for person 1\nNext n1 lines: two integers start and end representing each slot for person 1\nNext line: integer n2, number of slots for person 2\nNext n2 lines: two integers start and end representing each slot for person 2\nLast line: integer duration representing required meeting duration\nOutput Format:\nAn array of two integers [start, end] representing earliest possible meeting interval\nIf no common meeting interval exists, output []\nExample 1:\nInput: \n2\n10 50\n60 120\n2\n0 15\n60 70\n8\n\nOutput: \n[60, 68]\n\nExplanation\n- Person 1 is free [10,50] and [60,120].  \n- Person 2 is free [0,15] and [60,70].  \n- A common interval of length ≥ 8 exists starting at time 60 → [60,68].  \nExample 2:\nInput: \n2\n10 20\n30 40\n2\n15 25\n35 50\n15\n\nOutput: \n[]\n\nExplanation\n- Common overlaps are [15,20] and [35,40].  \n- Both overlaps are shorter than required duration (15).  \n- Hence, no valid meeting slot exists.  \nConstraints:\n1 ≤ n1, n2 ≤ 10⁴\n0 ≤ start < end ≤ 10⁹\n1 ≤ duration ≤ 10⁹\nSlots within each person’s list are non-overlapping",

    "description": "You are given an m x n binary matrix (m rows, n columns) representing one video frame. Most cells are 0. If present, a single solid square of 1s (all ones, no holes) marks a book tag somewhere in the frame.\nWrite a function to detect this tag:\nIf the square exists, return the row and column of its top-left corner (0-indexed) and the size (side length) of the square.\nIf no such square exists, return that the size is 0 (you may return coordinates as -1 -1 0 or just 0, see Output Format).\nYou may assume:\nAt most one such square of 1s exists in the matrix.\nIf the square exists, its side length s is at least ⌈√n⌉, where n is the number of columns.\nInput Format:\nFirst line: two integers m n - number of rows and columns.\nNext m lines: each line has n integers (0 or 1) separated by spaces.\nOutput Format:\nIf a square tag is found: print three integers r c s where (r, c) is the top-left cell of the square and s is its side length.\nIf no square tag is found: print a single integer 0.\nExample 1:\nInput: \n6 8\n0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput: \n0 3 3\n\nExplanation\nThere is a 3x3 solid square of 1s whose top-left corner is at row 0, column 3. No other 1-squares of that size or larger exist. Since n=8, ⌈√n⌉=3, which matches the found size.\nExample 2:\nInput: \n5 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput: \n0\n\nExplanation\nThere are 1s in the matrix but no solid square of 1s. Therefore, no tag exists and we output 0.\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ m, n ≤ 1000\nMatrix values are 0 or 1\nAt most one solid square tag exists\nIf the tag exists, its side length s ≥ ⌈√n⌉ (with n being the number of columns)\nOutput must be 0-indexed for coordinates",

    "description": "You are given a weighted graph of cities (nodes) connected by roads (edges). Two people, A and B, start from two different cities and both need to get to the same destination city. They are allowed to travel independently or to meet at some intermediate city and then continue together toward the destination (if they travel together on a shared road segment they pay that road cost only once for that shared portion). All road costs are non-negative.\nCompute the minimum total cost required for both people to reach the destination city under these rules.\n(Equivalently, choose a meeting city X (which may be one of their start cities or the destination). A travels from A_start to X, B travels from B_start to X, then from X they both travel to dest - the shared final portion X → dest is paid once. Minimize total cost = dist(A_start,X) + dist(B_start,X) + dist(X,dest).)\nInput Format:\nFirst line: two integers n m — number of cities (nodes) and number of roads (edges). Cities are labeled 0 to n-1.\nNext m lines: each line has three integers u v w describing a road between city u and city v with cost w. Roads are undirected. (0 ≤ u,v < n, w ≥ 0)\nLast line: three integers A B dest — starting cities of person A and person B, and the destination city.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer: the minimum total cost for both to reach dest under the sharing rule. If it is impossible for either person to reach dest (so the trip is impossible), print -1.\nExample:\nCity 0 (A’s start) is marked in blue\nCity 2 (B’s start) is marked in green\nCity 5 (Destination) is marked in red\nAll other cities are gray\nEdge weights represent travel costs.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n6 7\n0 1 2\n0 2 5\n1 2 2\n1 3 3\n2 4 2\n3 5 5\n4 5 3\n0 2 5\n\nOutput:\n9\n\nExplanation:\nNodes: 0..5.

    "description": "You are given a set of hierarchical strings, where each string represents a path broken into parts. Along with each path, a numeric value is associated. Every part of the path contributes its value not only to itself but also to all of its ancestors in the hierarchy.\nYou need to compute the final total value for every leaf path (a path that does not have any child).\nFor example, in domain-like strings, \"mail.google.com\" has ancestors \"google.com\" and \"com\". If a value is assigned to \"mail.google.com\", it contributes to itself, \"google.com\", and \"com\". After processing all inputs, you must print the total value of each leaf path.\nInput Format:\nn\npath1 value1\npath2 value2\n...\npathn valuen\nn is the number of hierarchical strings.\nEach path is given in dot-separated format (like a domain) consisting only of lowercase alphabets.\nEach value is an integer.\nOutput Format:\nleaf_path1 total\nleaf_path2 total\n...\nPrint the leaf path and its computed total value. Order of output does not matter.\nExample 1:\nInput: \n3\nmail.google.com 10\ndrive.google.com 5\ncom 2\n\nOutput: \nmail.google.com 12\ndrive.google.com 7\n\nExplanation\n- \"mail.google.com\" contributes 10 to itself, 10 to \"google.com\", and 10 to \"com\".  \n- \"drive.google.com\" contributes 5 to itself, 5 to \"google.com\", and 5 to \"com\".  \n- \"com\" has direct value 2.  \nTotals at leaves:  \n- mail.google.com = 10 (self) + 2 (com direct) = 12  \n- drive.google.com = 5 (self) + 2 (com direct) = 7\nExample 2:\nInput: \n2\na.b.c 4\nx.y 3\n\nOutput: \na.b.c 4\nx.y 3\n\nExplanation\nBoth inputs are leaves.

    "description": "You need to build a Tab component that displays a list of tabs and a panel area for content. The component must support lazy loading of panel content and a few common variations.\nRequirements and behavior\nBasic behavior\n1.1 The component accepts an initial array of tabs. Each tab has an id and a title and either inline content or a content source such as a URL or a function that returns content.\n1.2 The component renders a visible tab bar and one active tab panel at a time.\n1.3 Clicking a tab title makes that tab active and shows its panel.\nLazy loading behavior\n2.1 If a tab panel is marked for lazy loading its content must not be requested or mounted until the tab becomes active.\n2.2 While lazy content is loading show a loading indicator inside the panel.\n2.3 If loading fails show a friendly error state and allow retry.\n2.4 Provide an option to cache loaded content so that revisiting a tab does not reload it. The option can be on or off.\nVisual and UI details\n3.1 The active tab must be visually distinct from inactive tabs.\n3.2 Panels must expand to fit their content while keeping layout stable.\n3.3 Include a visible loading indicator and a visible error message when fetch fails.\n3.4 If tabs are scrollable on small screens ensure the active tab is visible after activation.\nData and API shape examples\n4.1 Example tab item shape for input data for example purposes only\n{ id: \"t1\", title: \"Overview\", content: \"<div>...</div>\" }  \n{ id: \"t2\", title: \"Details\", url: \"/api/details\" }  \n4.2 Make clear how the component receives the data and how it exposes events such as onTabChange or onTabClose.",

    "description": "You are controlling a robot cleaner placed in a rectangular grid room. Each cell in the grid is either empty or blocked. The robot does not know the room layout in advance.\nThe robot has the following capabilities through its API:\ninterface Robot {\n  // Returns true if the next cell is open and the robot moves into it.\n  // Returns false if the next cell is blocked and the robot stays in place.\n  boolean move();\n\n  // Turns the robot 90 degrees to the left.\n  void turnLeft();\n\n  // Turns the robot 90 degrees to the right.\n  void turnRight();\n\n  // Cleans the current cell.\n  void clean();\n}\nThe robot can only interact with the environment using the above API. It starts at an unknown position and facing an arbitrary direction.\nYour task is to design an algorithm to ensure that the robot cleans every reachable empty cell in the room.\nInput Format:\nThere is no direct input for the algorithm. The room is modeled internally and hidden from the robot. The robot can only explore it through the given API.\nOutput Format:\nThere is no explicit output. The robot should call clean() on every reachable empty cell exactly once.\nExample 1:\nInput: \nRoom layout (hidden to robot):\n1 = empty, 0 = blocked\n[1,1,1,1]\n[1,0,0,1]\n[1,1,1,1]\n\nRobot initial position: (1, 3) facing left\n\nOutput: \nAll reachable empty cells cleaned.\n\nExplanation\nThe robot must explore the room systematically. Even though the layout is hidden, the robot uses movement and turns to eventually reach all empty cells and clean them.\nExample 2:\nInput: \nRoom layout (hidden to robot):\n[1,0,1]\n[1,1,1]\n\nRobot initial position: (0, 0) facing down\n\nOutput: \nAll reachable empty cells cleaned.\n\nExplanation\nThe robot cannot move into blocked cells, but it must visit and clean all connected empty cells starting from its initial position.\nConstraints:\nRoom dimensions are at most 200 x 200.\nRobot initial position is on an empty cell.\nThe number of accessible cells will not exceed 20,000.\nThe algorithm must not rely on prior knowledge of the grid layout.",

    "description": "You are given a positive integer n. Your goal is to find all 'magic numbers' that fall within the range from 1 to n, inclusive.\nA number is defined as a 'magic number' if the absolute difference between any two of its adjacent digits is exactly 1. All single-digit numbers (1 through 9) are automatically considered magic numbers.\nFor instance, numbers like 12, 21, and 232 qualify as magic numbers. However, 13 and 245 do not, as the difference between adjacent digits is not 1.\nInput Format:\nA single integer n.\nOutput Format:\nA list of all magic numbers from 1 to n, sorted in ascending order.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n25\n\nOutput:\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 21, 23]\n\nExplanation:\nThese are all the numbers between 1 and 25 that meet the magic number criteria. For example, in the number 23, the absolute difference between 2 and 3 is 1. Numbers like 11, 13, and 22 are not included.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n100\n\nOutput:\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 21, 23, 32, 34, 43, 45, 54, 56, 65, 67, 76, 78, 87, 89, 98]\n\nExplanation:\nThe list includes all magic numbers up to 100. For example, 32 is included because abs(3-2) = 1, and 98 is included because abs(9-8) = 1.\nConstraints:\n1 <= n <= 10^9",

    "description": "You are given n players, each holding a unique rank from 1 (the best) to n (the worst). In any match, a player with a better rank (a lower number) will always defeat a player with a worse rank (a higher number).\nYou are also provided with a list of match results. Each result is a pair (a, b), indicating that player a defeated player b.\nYour task is to determine for how many players their exact rank can be precisely identified based on the given match outcomes.\nA player's rank is considered 'determined' if the number of players they are known to be better than, plus the number of players known to be better than them, equals n - 1.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains an integer n, the total number of players.\nThe second line contains an integer m, the number of match results.\nThe next m lines each contain two space-separated integers, winner and loser.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer representing the count of players whose rank can be determined with certainty.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n5\n5\n4 3\n4 2\n3 2\n1 2\n2 5\n\nOutput:\n2\n\nExplanation:\nLet's analyze the relationships:\n- Player 4 beat 3 and 2, 3 beat 2, 1 beat 2, 2 beat 5. \n- Transitive relationships: \n  - 4 beats 3, 2, 5. \n  - 3 beats 2, 5.\n  - 1 beats 2, 5. \n- Player 4 has 3 players they are better than (3, 2, 5) and 0 players they are worse than. Total known relationships = 3. Not enough to determine rank out of 5 players.\n- Player 2 has 1 player they are better than (5) and 3 players they are worse than (4, 3, 1). Total known relationships = 1 + 3 = 4. This is `n-1`, so player 2's rank is determined.\n- Player 5 has 0 players they are better than and 4 players they are worse than (4, 3, 1, 2). Total known relationships = 0 + 4 = 4. This is `n-1`, so player 5's rank is also determined.\n\nOnly players 2 and 5 have a determined rank. Thus, the output is 2.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n4\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n\nOutput:\n4\n\nExplanation:\n- Player 1 beats 2, 3, and 4 (transitively). They have 3 known wins and 0 losses.

    "description": "You are given a dataset of application versions. Each version is described by its name, a release order, and an operating system (OS) compatibility range defined by a minOS and maxOS. This range is inclusive. The minOS can be negative infinity, and maxOS can be positive infinity, indicating an open-ended range.\nYour task is to create a function that takes a target OS version as input. This function should return the name of the application that supports the target OS and has the highest release order. If multiple applications support the OS, the one with the larger release order is considered \"later\". If no application supports the given OS, you should return a null or equivalent value.\nInput Format:\nA list of application details.

If a vertex is unreachable from the source, its distance should be considered infinity. The algorithm should also be able to detect if the graph contains a negative-weight cycle, as such a cycle would mean that a shortest path is not well-defined.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers, V (number of vertices) and E (number of edges).\nThe next E lines each contain three space-separated integers u, v, and w, representing a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v with weight w.\nThe last line contains a single integer S, the source vertex.\nOutput Format:\nIf no negative cycle is detected, return a single line containing V space-separated integers, where the i-th integer is the shortest distance from the source S to vertex i. If a vertex is unreachable, represent its distance with a very large number (e.g., 10^9).\nIf a negative cycle is found, return the string \"Negative-weight cycle detected\".\nExample 1:\nInput:\n5 8\n0 1 -1\n0 2 4\n1 2 3\n1 3 2\n1 4 2\n3 2 5\n3 1 1\n4 3 -3\n0\n\nOutput:\n0 -1 2 -2 1\n\nExplanation:\nThe shortest distances from the source vertex 0 to all other vertices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are calculated.

    "description": "You are given a grid of size W x H, representing a city layout. You need to place N office buildings in this grid. Your goal is to find an arrangement of these N buildings such that the maximum distance from any empty lot to its nearest office is minimized. Movement is restricted to four directions (up, down, left, right), and diagonal moves are not allowed. The distance between adjacent cells is 1.\nReturn the minimized maximum distance.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains three integers: W (width), H (height), and N (number of offices).\nOutput Format:\nA single integer representing the minimum possible value for the maximum distance from any lot to the nearest office.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n3 3 1\n\nOutput:\n2\n\nExplanation:\nWith a 3x3 grid and 1 office to place, the optimal position for the office is the center cell (1,1). The lots at the corners are at a distance of 2 from the center (e.g., (0,0) to (1,1) requires one step right and one step down). All other lots are at a distance of 1. The maximum distance is therefore 2. Placing the office anywhere else would result in a maximum distance of 3 or 4.\nConstraints:\n1 <= W, H <= 10\nW * H <= 28\n1 <= N <= 5",

Customers will upload their code and data, specify the required number of GPUs, and set an expected training duration, and our platform schedules, provisions, and runs the job.\nFunctional Requirements:\nJob Submission: Users must be able to upload their code and datasets (as a directory) and specify job parameters like GPU count and maximum runtime.\nResource Allocation: The system must efficiently allocate GPUs to jobs to maximize hardware utilization.\nJob Scheduling: Implement a scheduling strategy that handles job priorities and ensures fairness. For instance, consider factors like waiting time and job size to prevent starvation of large jobs.\nExecution and Monitoring: The platform should manage the lifecycle of concurrent training jobs, track their status (e.g., pending, running, completed, failed), and provide access to logs.\nData Persistence: The user's code and data must be persisted in cloud storage and made available to the training job environment when it runs.\nNon-Functional Requirements:\nScalability: The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent job submissions and scale the GPU cluster as needed.\nReliability: Ensure that jobs are not lost in case of component failures.\nBilling and Monitoring Support: The system should produce logs and metrics sufficient for billing customers based on resource consumption and for internal monitoring.",

    "description": "You are given an array of numbers, an initial battery capacity, and a number of superchargers. Starting from index 0, you want to traverse as far as possible through the array. Your task is to calculate the maximum index you can reach.\nThe rules for moving from index i to i+1 are as follows:\nFree Move: If the next element array[i+1] is less than or equal to the current element array[i], you can move to the next index without using any resources.\nMove with Resources: If array[i+1] is greater than array[i], you must use one of the following resources to make the move:\nBattery: If the difference array[i+1] - array[i] is less than or equal to your current battery level, you can use the battery. Your battery level will be reduced by this amount.\nSupercharger: If you cannot use the battery (due to insufficient charge) or choose not to, you can use a supercharger, provided you have any left. Using a supercharger does not affect your battery level.\nDetermine the highest index you can successfully reach.\nInput Format:\narray: A list of integers.\nbattery: An integer representing the initial battery capacity.\nsuperchargers: An integer representing the number of available superchargers.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer representing the maximum index reached.\nExample 1:\nInput:\narray = [50, 150, 100, 250, 200, 400, 500, 300, 600]\nbattery = 200\nsuperchargers = 2\n\nOutput:\n7\n\nExplanation:\nA possible path is:\n- Move from index 0 to 1 (50 to 150): The difference is 100. Use 100 from the battery. Remaining battery: 100.\n- Move from 1 to 2 (150 to 100): Free move.\n- Move from 2 to 3 (100 to 250): Difference is 150, which is more than the remaining battery. Use 1 supercharger. Remaining superchargers: 1.\n- Move from 3 to 4 (250 to 200): Free move.\n- Move from 4 to 5 (200 to 400): Difference is 200, which is more than the remaining battery. Use 1 supercharger. Remaining superchargers: 0.\n- Move from 5 to 6 (400 to 500): Difference is 100. Use 100 from the battery. Remaining battery: 0.\n- Move from 6 to 7 (500 to 300): Free move.\n- Cannot move from 7 to 8 (300 to 600) as both battery and superchargers are exhausted.\nThe furthest index reached is 7.\nConstraints:\n1 <= array.length <= 10^5\n1 <= array[i] <= 10^9\n0 <= battery <= 10^9\n0 <= superchargers <= array.length",

If t[i] is -1, the node has no time limit; otherwise, you can only visit node i if your current travel time is strictly less than t[i].\nYou start at node 1 at time 0. Your goal is to find the minimum time required to travel from node 1 to every other node in the graph, respecting the time limit constraints.\nReturn an array of size n, where the i-th element is the minimum time to reach node i+1.

    "description": "You are given a string S which consists only of three types of characters: 'A', 'B', and '-'. Your objective is to transform S such that all 'A' characters form a single, contiguous block within the string. You need to achieve this with the minimum possible total cost.\nThere are two types of operations, each with an associated cost:\nMoving an 'A': The cost of moving an 'A' character to a position currently occupied by a '-' (an empty slot) is x.\nConverting a 'B': The cost of converting a 'B' character into a '-' (an empty slot) is y.\nCrucially, an 'A' character cannot be moved directly into a position currently occupied by a 'B'. If an 'A' needs to occupy a slot where a 'B' currently resides, that 'B' must first be converted into a '-' at cost y. After this conversion, the 'A' can then move into the now-empty slot at an additional cost of x. Therefore, the total cost for an 'A' to occupy a spot that was initially a 'B' is x + y.\nYou will be given Q queries. For each query, you will receive a specific pair of costs, x and y. For each query, you must calculate and return the minimum total cost to make all 'A' characters in S contiguous.\nInput Format:\nFirst line: A string S (length N).\nSecond line: An integer Q, representing the number of queries.\nNext Q lines: Each line contains two space-separated integers, x and y, for the current query.\nOutput Format:\nFor each query, output a single integer representing the minimum cost.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nA-BA-BA\n1\n1 2\n\nOutput:\n8\nConstraints:\n1 <= N, Q <= 10^5\nS consists only of characters 'A', 'B', '-'\n0 <= x, y <= 10^9",

    "description": "A robot is placed in a rectangular maze. The maze is represented by a 2D matrix where each cell can be one of three types:\n#: A wall, which the robot cannot pass through.\n.: An empty cell, which the robot can move into.\nE: An escape point, where the robot successfully exits the maze.\nThe robot is \"blind\" and can move in four directions: Right (R), Up (U), Left (L), Down (D). It does not know its current position or the layout of the maze. Your task is to devise a universal sequence of commands (e.g., \"DRR\", \"RU\") such that no matter which valid empty cell the robot starts from, if it executes this sequence of commands, it will eventually reach an 'E' (escape point) and exit the maze.\nThe robot executes commands one by one. If a command attempts to move the robot into a wall, the robot simply stays in its current cell but the command is still considered executed. The robot can exit the maze early if it reaches an 'E' at any point during the command execution, even if the command sequence is not fully completed.\nYour goal is to find any such sequence of commands. An optimal solution would aim for the shortest possible command sequence.\nInput Format:\nThe input will be a 2D matrix representing the maze.\nThe first line contains two integers R and C, representing the number of rows and columns of the maze.\nThe next R lines each contain a string of C characters, where each character is '#', '.', or 'E'.\nOutput Format:\nA single string representing the universal command sequence.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n4 5\n#####\n#...#\n#..E#\n#####\n\nOutput:\nDRR\n\nExplanation:\nLet's trace from all possible starting points:\n- From (1,1) (top-left '.'):\n  - D: moves to (2,1)\n  - R: moves to (2,2)\n  - R: moves to (2,3) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\n- From (1,2):\n  - D: moves to (2,2)\n  - R: moves to (2,3) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\n- From (1,3):\n  - D: moves to (2,3) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\n- From (2,1):\n  - D: hits wall, stays at (2,1)\n  - R: moves to (2,2)\n  - R: moves to (2,3) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\n- From (2,2):\n  - D: hits wall, stays at (2,2)\n  - R: moves to (2,3) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\n- From (2,3) ('E'): Robot already at escape point, implicitly escapes.\nThe sequence \"DRR\" ensures escape from all valid starting points.\nExample 2:\nInput:\n4 4\n####\n#.E#\n##.#\n####\n\nOutput:\nRU\n\nExplanation:\nLet's trace from all possible starting points:\n- From (1,1) (top-left '.'):\n  - R: moves to (1,2) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\n- From (2,2) (bottom '.'):\n  - R: hits wall, stays at (2,2)\n  - U: moves to (1,2) which is 'E'. Robot escapes.\nThe sequence \"RU\" ensures escape from all valid starting points.\nConstraints:\n1 <= R, C <= 50\nEach cell contains '#', '.', or 'E'.\nThere will be at least one 'E' (escape point) in the maze.\nThere will be at least one '.' (empty cell) from which the robot can start.",

The starting leaf node for Agent B will also be specified.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer representing the maximum points Agent A can collect.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nTree Structure (simplified representation):\n        10 (root)\n       /  \\\n      5    8\n     / \\\n    3   6 (B starts here)\nNode Values: 10, 5, 8, 3, 6\nStarting Leaf for B: Node 6\n\nOutput:\n18\n\nExplanation:\nAssume B's path is fixed from Node 6 upwards: 6 (Time 0) -> 5 (Time 1) -> 10 (Time 2).\n\nAgent A starts at Root Node 10 (Time 0).\n\nPossible paths for A to maximize points:\n1. A moves 10 (Time 0) -> 5 (Time 1) -> 3 (Time 2)\n   - Node 10: A visits first. Points: 10.\n   - Node 5: Both A and B visit at Time 1. Points: 5 / 2 = 2 (integer division).\n   - Node 3: A visits first. Points: 3.\n   Total points for A: 10 + 2 + 3 = 15.\n\n2. A moves 10 (Time 0) -> 8 (Time 1)\n   - Node 10: A visits first. Points: 10.\n   - Node 8: A visits first. Points: 8.\n   Total points for A: 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nComparing paths, the maximum points A can collect is 18.\nConstraints:\nThe tree will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.\nNode values are positive integers between 1 and 1000.\nEach node (except root) has a parent pointer. The root's parent pointer is null.\nThe specified starting node for Agent B will always be a leaf node.",

    "description": "You are given a 2D grid locationMap of characters, where 'O' represents a robot, 'E' represents an empty cell, and 'X' represents a blocker. The boundaries of the map (i.e., cells outside the grid) are also considered blockers.\nYou are also given a query array [dist_left, dist_top, dist_bottom, dist_right]. Each dist_X value specifies the minimum required distance from a robot to the closest blocker in that cardinal direction.\nFor a robot located at (R, C), calculate the actual distance to the closest blocker in each of the four cardinal directions. The distance is defined as the number of cells traversed (including empty 'E' cells) to reach the first 'X' or map boundary.\nA robot satisfies the query if its actual distance to the closest blocker in each direction is greater than or equal to the corresponding value in the query array.\nYour task is to return the coordinates [row, col] of all robots that satisfy the given query.\nInput Format:\nA 2D character array locationMap (rows x cols).\nA 1D integer array query of length 4, [dist_left, dist_top, dist_bottom, dist_right].\nOutput Format:\nA list of lists (or array of arrays) where each inner list [row, col] represents the coordinates of a robot satisfying the query. The order of coordinates in the output does not matter.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nlocationMap = [\n  ['O', 'E', 'E', 'X'],\n  ['E', 'E', 'O', 'E'],\n  ['X', 'E', 'E', 'E']\n]\nquery = [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nOutput:\n[[0, 0], [1, 2]]\n\nExplanation:\nLet's analyze the robot at (0,0) for query = [1, 1, 1, 1]:\n-   **Left:** Closest blocker is the boundary at column -1. Actual distance = 1. Query `dist_left = 1`. (1 >= 1) is True.\n-   **Top:** Closest blocker is the boundary at row -1. Actual distance = 1. Query `dist_top = 1`. (1 >= 1) is True.\n-   **Bottom:** Cell `(1,0)` is 'E', `(2,0)` is 'X'. Closest blocker is `(2,0)`. Actual distance = 2. Query `dist_bottom = 1`. (2 >= 1) is True.\n-   **Right:** Cell `(0,1)` is 'E', `(0,2)` is 'E', `(0,3)` is 'X'. Closest blocker is `(0,3)`. Actual distance = 3. Query `dist_right = 1`. (3 >= 1) is True.\nSince all conditions are met, `[0,0]` is included in the output.\n\nLet's analyze the robot at (1,2) for query = [1, 1, 1, 1]:\n-   **Left:** Cell `(1,1)` is 'E', `(1,0)` is 'E'. Closest blocker is boundary at column -1. Actual distance = 3. Query `dist_left = 1`. (3 >= 1) is True.\n-   **Top:** Cell `(0,2)` is 'E'. Closest blocker is boundary at row -1. Actual distance = 2. Query `dist_top = 1`. (2 >= 1) is True.\n-   **Bottom:** Cell `(2,2)` is 'E'. Closest blocker is boundary at row 3. Actual distance = 2. Query `dist_bottom = 1`.

The system needs to account for various factors to determine the final daily rental cost, which then sums up for the entire booking period.\nYour low-level design should consider how to model the Vehicle, Booking, and Pricing components, ensuring the system is flexible and extensible to accommodate new pricing rules in the future.\nThe core requirements for the pricing calculation are as follows:\nBase Daily Rate based on Duration:\nA standard daily rate applies for bookings less than 5 days.\nA discounted daily rate applies for bookings of 5 days or more (e.g., a \"weekly\" rate).\nAn even lower daily rate applies for bookings covering a full month or more (e.g., a \"monthly\" rate).\nExample: A vehicle might have a base daily rate of $100, a weekly rate of $90 per day, and a monthly rate of $80 per day.\nWeekend Surcharges:\nSaturday bookings incur a 5% increase on the base daily rate.\nSunday bookings incur a 10% increase on the base daily rate.\nExample: If the base daily rate is $100, a Saturday would be $105, and a Sunday would be $110.\nFestival/Holiday Surcharges:\nSpecific festival days (e.g., December 25th, January 1st) incur a 20% increase.\nOther specified holidays (e.g., Thanksgiving) might incur a 15% increase.\nNote: These surcharges are cumulative with weekend surcharges if a festival day falls on a weekend.\nBooking Lead Time Adjustments:\nLast-minute booking: If a booking is made for a start date within the next 2 days, a 5% surcharge applies to the total rental price.\nEarly bird booking: If a booking is made for a start date more than 2 months in advance, a 5% discount applies to the total rental price.\nConsider the following examples to clarify the calculations: Assume a base daily rate of $100, a weekly rate of $90, and a monthly rate of $80 for a vehicle.\n2-day booking (Monday & Tuesday, non-festival): Total $200 (2 * $100).\n5-day booking (Monday to Friday, non-festival): Total $450 (5 * $90, using the weekly rate).\nFriday & Saturday booking (non-festival): Total $205 ($100 for Friday + $100 * 1.05 for Saturday).\nFriday, Saturday & Sunday booking (non-festival): Total $315 ($100 for Friday + $100 * 1.05 for Saturday + $100 * 1.10 for Sunday).\nFriday, Saturday & Sunday booking (Friday and Saturday are festival days): Total $356 ($100 * 1.20 for Friday + ($100 * 1.05) * 1.20 for Saturday + $100 * 1.10 for Sunday).\nYour design should clearly define the classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them to effectively implement this pricing logic. Focus on extensibility and maintainability.",

    "description": "You are given a forest – a collection of one or more rooted trees. Each node i has an integer rating r_i. You may start at any node and travel along the edges of a tree, never revisiting a node, forming a simple path. The length of a path is the number of nodes it contains. Given an integer K, find the maximum possible sum of ratings among all simple paths in the entire forest whose length does not exceed K.\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains two space‑separated integers N and K – the total number of nodes in the forest and the maximum allowed path length.\nThe second line contains N space‑separated integers r_1, r_2, …, r_N – the rating of each node (1‑based indexing).\nThe third line contains an integer M – the number of undirected edges. The next M lines each contain two integers u and v indicating an edge between node u and node v. The given edges form a forest (no cycles).\nOutput Format:\nA single integer – the maximum sum of ratings of any simple path whose length is at most K.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n7 3\n5 -2 3 4 1 -1 2\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n5 6\n5 7\nOutput:\n12\nExplanation The forest consists of one tree rooted at node 1.

    "description": "You are given a collection of N boxes. Each box i has three positive integers: height h_i, width w_i and depth d_i.\nYou may place a box on top of another box only if both its width and depth are strictly smaller than the width and depth of the box below it. The boxes cannot be rotated (the orientation given in the input must be kept). Your task is to arrange a subset of the boxes in a stack that satisfies the above rule and yields the greatest possible total height.\nInput Format:\nFirst line: an integer N – the number of boxes.\nThe next N lines: each line contains three space‑separated integers h_i w_i d_i representing the height, width and depth of the i‑th box.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer – the maximum achievable stack height.\nExample 1:\nInput:\n5\n4 6 7\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n10 12 15\n2 3 4\n\nOutput:\n21\nExplanation\nOne optimal stack is:\nBox 4 (10 × 12 × 15) → Box 1 (4 × 6 × 7) → Box 5 (2 × 3 × 4). The total height is 10 + 4 + 2 = 16.\nThe maximum height achievable with the given boxes is 21 by stacking Box 4 → Box 1 → Box 3 → Box 5 → Box 2, giving 10 + 4 + 4 + 2+ 1 + 2 =21\nExample 2:\nInput:\n3\n5 5 5\n3 4 6\n2 2 2\n\nOutput:\n7\nExplanation Box 1 cannot be placed on any other box because its width and depth are not smaller than any other box. The best stack is Box 2 (3 × 4 × 6) placed on top of Box 3 (2 × 2 × 2), giving a total height of 3 + 2 = 5. However, Box 1 alone gives height 5, and stacking Box 1 on top of Box 2 is invalid. The maximum achievable height is 7 by stacking Box 1 (5) on top of Box 3 (2).\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ N ≤ 100\n1 ≤ h_i, w_i, d_i ≤ 10⁴\nAll dimensions are integers.\nBoxes cannot be rotated; orientation is fixed.\nStacking rule: for a box placed on top, its width < width of box below and its depth < depth of box below.",

    "description": "You are given a single English sentence. Design a simple scoring function that evaluates the sentence based on three factors:\nWord Count – each word contributes 1 point.\nAverage Word Length – compute the average length of all words (ignoring punctuation) and add the floor of this value to the score.\nVowel Bonus – each vowel (a, e, i, o, u, case‑insensitive) adds 2 points.\nThe final score is the sum of the three contributions.\nInput Format:\nA single line containing the sentence. The sentence may include letters, spaces, and punctuation characters (.,!?:;). Words are sequences of alphabetic characters separated by spaces or punctuation.\nOutput Format:\nA single integer – the computed score of the sentence.\nExample 1:\nInput:\nHello, world!\n\nOutput:\n13\nExplanation The sentence has 2 words → 2 points. Word lengths are 5 and 5, average = 5 → floor(5) = 5 points. Vowels are e, o, o → 3 vowels × 2 = 6 points. Total = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13. (Since punctuation is ignored, the correct total is 13; the example output reflects the intended calculation.)\nExample 2:\nInput:\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n\nOutput:\n34\nExplanation There are 9 words → 9 points. Total letters = 35, average length = 35/9 ≈ 3.88 → floor = 3 points. Vowels = 11 → 11 × 2 = 22 points. Total = 9 + 3 + 22 = 34. (The example output shows the intended final score after applying the same rules.)\nConstraints:\n1 ≤ length of sentence ≤ 10^5 characters\nSentence contains printable ASCII characters only\nProcessing must run in O(n) time where n is the length of the input",
