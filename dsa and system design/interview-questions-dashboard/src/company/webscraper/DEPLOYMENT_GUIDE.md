# 🚀 Static Dashboard Deployment Guide

## 📱 Mobile & Browser Access Options

You now have **3 different ways** to access your Interview Questions Dashboard without needing a local development server:

### Option 1: 📄 Embedded Dashboard (Recommended for Mobile/GitHub)
**File**: `embedded_dashboard.html` (2.0 MB)
- ✅ **Single file** - no dependencies
- ✅ **Works offline** - data embedded in HTML
- ✅ **Mobile friendly** - responsive design

### Option 2: 🏗️ React Production Build (Best Performance)
**Location**: `react-dashboard/build/` folder
