## Recommended AI Models

### Primary Recommendation: GPT-4 or Claude-3.5-Sonnet
**Why these models?**
- Superior architectural reasoning and system design knowledge
- Better at generating ASCII diagrams and technical documentation
- Strong understanding of scalability patterns and trade-offs
- Consistent adherence to structured prompts
- Deep knowledge of industry best practices

### Alternative Options:
- **Claude-3-Opus**: Good alternative with strong reasoning
- **GPT-4-Turbo**: Faster response times, good technical depth
- **Gemini Ultra**: Google's flagship model with strong technical knowledge

## Usage Instructions

### Method 1: Individual Questions
1. Choose a question from the `prompts/` directory
2. Copy the entire prompt content
3. Paste into your chosen AI model
4. Review and refine the generated answer
5. Save as markdown file for the specific question

### Method 2: Batch Processing
1. Use `all_system_design_prompts.md` for processing multiple questions
2. Split into smaller batches if hitting token limits
3. Process each question section separately

### Method 3: Custom Prompts
1. Use `system_design_prompt_template.md` as base
2. Replace placeholders with specific question data
3. Modify sections based on question complexity

## Quality Guidelines

### For AI Model Interaction:
- Always specify the difficulty level and company context
- Ask for clarification if the generated answer lacks technical depth
- Request ASCII diagrams for complex architectural components
- Validate technical accuracy of the generated content

### Answer Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Problem understanding section addresses core requirements
- [ ] High-level architecture includes ASCII diagrams
- [ ] API design follows REST/GraphQL best practices
- [ ] Database schema is properly normalized
- [ ] Trade-offs discussion covers CAP theorem implications
- [ ] Security considerations are comprehensive
- [ ] Monitoring and observability are addressed
- [ ] Follow-up scenarios are realistic and challenging

## Tips for Better Results

### Prompt Optimization:
1. **Be Specific**: Include exact scale requirements and constraints
2. **Context Matters**: Mention the company's known tech stack when relevant
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Ask for deeper dives on specific sections
4. **Real-world Focus**: Request practical implementation details

### Example Follow-up Prompts:
```
"Can you provide more detailed ASCII diagrams for the database sharding strategy?"
"Expand on the monitoring section with specific metrics and alerting strategies"
"Add a detailed analysis of the circuit breaker pattern implementation"
"Include code examples for the API endpoints"
```

## Company-Specific Considerations

### FAANG Companies (Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google):
- Emphasize massive scale (billions of users)
- Focus on global distribution and latency
- Include ML/AI integration opportunities
- Discuss cost optimization at scale

### Financial Services (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs):
- Prioritize consistency and ACID compliance
- Include comprehensive security measures
- Address regulatory compliance requirements
- Focus on audit trails and data lineage

### Startups/Scale-ups:
- Balance sophistication with simplicity
- Consider MVP vs full-scale architecture
- Include migration strategies
- Focus on developer productivity

## Expected Answer Quality

### Excellent Answer Characteristics:
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all 10 required sections
- **Technical Depth**: Appropriate for the stated difficulty level
- **Practical**: Includes real-world constraints and considerations
- **Visual**: Contains ASCII diagrams and clear explanations
- **Interactive**: Structured as a conversation with an interviewer

### Red Flags to Avoid:
- Generic answers that could apply to any question
- Missing trade-off discussions
- No mention of failure scenarios
- Lack of specific technology recommendations
- Oversimplified architecture for complex problems

## Success Metrics
A high-quality answer should:
1. Take 45-60 minutes to present in an interview setting
2. Demonstrate senior-level architectural thinking
3. Include specific numbers and calculations
4. Address follow-up questions proactively
5. Show understanding of business constraints

## Continuous Improvement
- Update prompts based on latest industry practices
- Incorporate new design patterns and technologies
- Refine based on actual interview feedback
- Add company-specific templates as needed
